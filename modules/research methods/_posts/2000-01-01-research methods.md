# Selecting the research methods

When selecting appropriate research methods for studying oTPD programmes, there are a range of considerations to be made. This section summarises the methods selected for this study including strengths and limitations of the approach. This is offered on the following two pages in a discussion of using design-based research (DBR) as well as the research phases and approach to data collection and analysis.

Summary of key learning:
- Studies should articulate the rationale for the research, and clearly define the research context.
- The research paradigm and theoretical framework for the research should be articulated. For this study, I opted for a research worldview instead of a selected paradigm, which incorporated a pragmatic set of philosophical assumptions of the nature of knowledge as socially constructed and a product of human interests (Habermas, 1968; Freire, 1970), elements of critical realism and theory (i.e. change theories that help with creating practical improvements and changes), non-representational theory in order to focus on practices instead of studying and representing social relationships (Thrift, 2008; Dewsbury, 2000; Merleau-Ponty, 2002)

Research questions

This study was guided by three main research questions:

1. How can technology afford new forms of dialogue to support the development of a teacher community of practice in which practitioners reflect together, support one another, and share practice?
2. To what extent can a mechanical MOOC afford opportunities to enhance dialogue between in-service teachers within an inquiry-based TPD programme?
- What are the key enablers and barriers for the use of dialogic pedagogy in oTPD programmes?
- What influences a teacher’s participation in online peer dialogue?
- How do in-service teachers perceive and experience online learning in reference to their professional development?
3. What design principles help to make the model scalable and sustainable?

The theory of change at the outset of the study was:

> If teachers build a dialogue with one another within online TPD programmes, through reflecting together, sharing resources and supporting one another, they will form a sustainable community of practice, which will enhance their use of dialogic teaching in the classroom.

To test this theory of change, the MOOC series was designed, trialled and assessed as the intervention. Below is a visual summary of the logic model of this intervention.

Inputs included: (i) the MOOC host site via github , (ii) the T-SEDA toolkit contents and materials including additional materials produced by the Cambridge Educational Dialogue Research (CEDiR) team, and (iii) a discussion forum via a resource website, edudialogue.org . The activities that were developed from these inputs included: (i) video tutorials and readings, (ii) individual, pair and group work activities, and (iii) discussion forum contributions. These activities did not seek to transmit knowledge regarding standardised uses of dialogic pedagogy, but rather developed resources and activities for local contextualisation to support its use, as emphasised by Hennessy et al. (2021). The outputs from participation in these activities included: (i) participant engagement and understanding through reflection and creation, (ii) developing a shared vision of dialogic pedagogy, and (iii) sharing resources, contributing to one another’s ideas and learning, and other forms of peer support. Building on these outputs, the outcomes that came from this intervention included: (i) more effective use of dialogic pedagogy in practice, and (ii) the formation of a peer network and community of practice. Areas of impact include: (i) sustained usage of resources and a dialogic approach at a local level, (ii) metacognitive growth for practitioners, and (iii) sustained participation in a community of practice. The literature supported this initial theory of change, evidencing connections between the inputs and outputs, but the intervention went beyond the evidence to fill a theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical gap where there is currently a need for accessible, effective, sustainable and scalable professional learning opportunities and underpinning theories that may explain what works well and what does not.
