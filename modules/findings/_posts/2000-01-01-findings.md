This chapter presents the findings from the research and associated discussion. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 present the design principles as two separate publications regarding their formation, testing and refinement. Section 5.3 adds further considerations through the discussion of insights from sector specialists and relates these to the findings. 
This dissertation explored whether a mechanical MOOC on educational dialogue can afford new, sustainable and scalable opportunities for local facilitators and practitioners to collaborate, reflect together, support one another and share their learning and practice. Drawing on the findings from the intervention, ten design principles were developed for scalable and sustainable online professional development course models and communities of practice that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment, and that view educators as valuable creators and contributors to professional learning resources.
This sectionâ€™s content appears in two open access publications produced from the findings of the MOOC trials, co-authored by CEDiR group colleagues. The first publication was co-authored with my supervisor Professor Sara Hennessy and offers the first iteration of the design principles. In the same way as the rest of the original work presented in this thesis, the work was led by myself with supervisor guidance; likewise I drafted the article and received a small amount of supervisor input. The second publication is an extension of these initial design principles, whereby the design principles were tested and refined accordingly. This publication was co-authored with Dr Farah Ahmed, with myself leading the research analysis and writing, and with continued support from Farah regarding the conceptual framework, writing, and revisions.
