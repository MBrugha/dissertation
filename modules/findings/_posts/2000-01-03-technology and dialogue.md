5.3. Further design considerations
This section presents an overview of further design considerations of oTPD and implications for related programmes. This extends from the preceding two chapters, and includes insights from key sector informants from their interview transcripts. Their names have been provided with their permission. 
As the findings from this research indicate, while technology can provide new forms of dialogue between practitioners and enhance access to professional learning opportunities to a wide range of educators globally, technology has also introduced new variables and barriers such as digital literacy and issues regarding access to connectivity and devices. Michael (Cambridge University Press) similarly noted that “initially technology was an enabler and now it is a barrier. The functionality is not good enough to facilitate the types of human interactions we need”. Using technology to pursue learning opportunities may also be stressful for participants who are experiencing virtual fatigue, particularly following the Covid-19 pandemic. As Lisa (Generation Global) pointed out, “using technology can be emotionally, physically and mentally exhausting”. Katherine (MIT Media Lab) recognised this exhaustion as well and recommended “creating an authentic community that practitioners want to be a part of… Participants need a shared identity with trust amongst them”. This reflects the importance of fostering a dialogic ethos and culture of inclusion and respect.
The above findings point to the importance of oTPD design placing the pedagogy first, and then fitting the technology around this to promote the aims of the course. Interestingly, it is often the most simplified structures and technologies that can have the highest usage and strongest impact. Lisa noted that they use WhatsApp in their oTPD courses: “it is not revolutionary but the way we use WhatsApp groups is contextual”. Dirk (P2PU) similarly recommended prioritising simplicity and navigability in technology design: “If you think about an LMS, it is often complicated with the content paywalled, and there are a lot of traditional components like quizzes after each section. This is formal and restrictive.” Michael similarly noted how significant investments in studios and equipment to create engaging knowledge products for learners did not have the return on investment that was perhaps anticipated. He explained that this “is not engaging and loses the human element. Learners might prefer the low-tech options.” This exemplifies the importance of user-centred design and understanding the needs of the learners, their preferences regarding technology, and their prior experiences with it as it relates to their learning and collaboration with others. If the aim is to create a community, Michael noted that “something recorded simply on a phone feels very human and natural” as opposed to high-tech equipment. This was echoed in the data, with MOOC participants in the KIIs stating that they enjoyed the more ‘undone’ components of the course videos, which made them feel like we were having a conversation instead of me providing information (as articulated by MOOC participant, trial 1, KII transcript). The technology utilised in mechanical MOOCs leverages this understanding and focuses on what makes the most sense and has the highest relevance for the users.
Through having technology components that learners are already familiar with, this can increase their capacity to engage in collaborative work and peer-to-peer dialogue. As Lisa noted, “It is quite hard to sustain human interpersonal relationships with hundreds of people” especially when the objective is to create a dialogue. This means not broadcasting learning products, but rather creating avenues for collaboration and co-construction of knowledge. Lisa explained a peer learning strategy they employ through “having participants lead different parts of the course”. 
Regarding the ways in which technology can support the development of a teacher community of practice, Grif (P2PU) observed that the ability to control one’s own space online via platforms like mechanical MOOCs that enable teacher agency contributes to forming a community. This goes beyond participants creating this for themselves (for example, forming WhatsApp groups to engage with their peers following the end of a course), and there is instead a need for course design to incorporate connections between practitioners following the end of a cohort. Michael also recommends that there is an intentional element to the design for post-course collaboration and that the facilitation of further connections between participants ensures “diversity exists within communities of practice without taking ownership of them or over-designing”.
Katherine built on this and noted that design constraints are critical to explore, especially when the aim is to provide learners with agency and ensure their voices remain central to the programme design and facilitation. She recommended incorporating easily adaptable resources and opportunities and frameworks for reflective thought. This resonates with the notion of scaffolding, as articulated in Design Principle 2.
The regulatory environment and amount of institutional support and alignment with the course pedagogy of focus and its delivery model deeply affected participants’ uptake of the materials and the implementation of those materials into their practice. As Lisa also explained, “Designing a course and offering it for free is not enough. Teachers need recognition from their school, communities, and to see that their time spent on the materials is valued”. Katherine offered specific questions for course designers to consider regarding this: 
Is there support at the district level for teachers to spend the time to think deeply about these research questions? Are there supports in place to help them feel empowered? Otherwise, if you build a tool, it is only going to be able to be engaged with by teachers who have the most comfortable positions or have more time.
In addition to the design principles identified above, the importance of the role of the local facilitator continued to emerge as critical in discussions regarding scalability, sustainability and impact in these conversations. This relates back to the mechanical model and the focus on leveraging technology for enhancing community not only globally but within the local settings of practitioners as well. These insights provide greater clarity for the findings that emerged from the data analysis and substantiate the design principles. They also help provide further implications for policy and practice, which are summarised in Section 7.2.
