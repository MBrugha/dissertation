# Case Study 1: Local impact of a global MOOC

## Overview

This case study was developed in order to explore the impact of the MOOC on participants’ perceptions and practice, particularly considering the different ways this manifested in varied contexts. Leveraging the part-time nature of the PhD, this case study was used to follow up with participants two years after taking the first MOOC trial. This built on the findings articulated in Chapter 5 and included additional KIIs and questionnaires with four participants based in three different countries: the United Kingdom (UK), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran. In addition, this study drew on an analysis of the 45 reflective reports submitted as final learning products for the third MOOC trial in order to explore other features of impact.

## Background

As online professional learning opportunities have become increasingly available, so too have opportunities for educators to leverage the course content as well as the online networks created as part of these courses to access new knowledge. However, knowledge alone cannot change practice (Levin, 2008) and teachers go through a complex process of reconstructing new knowledge before it can manifest in change to their perceptions and practice (if at all).

The wider study sought to build a course that went beyond a six-week programme and convene a community of practice in which educators could continue to share insights, practice and resources with one another. These types of networks that promote collaboration and sharing between teachers as a way to support their professional development have been associated with improvements in student learning outcomes (e.g. see Katz & Earl, 2010). In addition, oTPD courses and online knowledge sharing platforms provide educators with more control and agency to select learning opportunities that are most relevant to their interests and settings (Dede 2000), share resources and insights, and to reflect on their practice (Wesely 2013). This can enable more efficient knowledge mobilisation processes for educators to transfer new knowledge into their practice and potentially also disseminate this knowledge to their peers.

Levin (2008) argues that knowledge mobilisation has become a more significant focus in the sector (in all sectors, in fact), which has only been enhanced since the time of his writing by technology and internet-mediated learning opportunities that potentially have a significantly wider reach to create and share new knowledge. However, it is also clear that knowledge and practice are deeply intertwined with social and cultural factors. Levin (2008) states that “knowledge takes shape and has effect in a wide variety of ways, but is always mediated through various social and political processes” (p. 8). This means that there is no simple and generalisable pathway for educators pursuing oTPD to turn new knowledge into new practice, which is particularly the case in an international MOOC with participants from highly varied settings. There is also a risk that because of challenges with adopting resources to make them more relevant for local settings, teachers may favour resources that reinforce their existing perceptions and practices rather than ones that might reorient them (Hood, 2018).

In their review of the literature on oTPD, Dede et al. (2009) found that few studies sought to measure how educators make sense of new knowledge or how they apply it in their practice. As oTPD opportunities continue to grow, more evidence is needed regarding the phases of knowledge mobilisation beyond the production of more knowledge through oTPD and their associated online networks. This includes an understanding of the mediating factors that influence the knowledge mobilisation process.

## Aims

This case study explores the ways in which the MOOC affected participants’ perceptions and practice. While the wider study examined the impact of the course at a broad level, it did not collect data on how participants reconstructed the knowledge shared via course content and others’ contributions in order to adapt it to their own contexts. This case study therefore asks three questions that have guided the research:

_RQ1: How did participants reconstruct the knowledge from the MOOC in order to adapt it to their local settings?
RQ2: How did this knowledge reconstruction process impact participants’ perceptions and practices?
RQ3: Which course and design factors influenced changes in perceptions and practices?_

It was the objective of this case study to contribute towards a better understanding of how educators reconstruct and use knowledge from oTPD and how this impacts their perspectives and practice, including whether new knowledge has been embedded and new practice can be sustained. This has implications for course designers and facilitators in recognising and designing for the factors that influence the knowledge mobilisation process.

## Methods

This case study builds on findings from the wider study, particularly those discussed in Chapter 5.2 regarding shifts in participants’ perceptions and practices. Case study methodology (Hamilton, 2011) was utilised to explore the above research questions regarding the ways in which oTPD participants reconstruct knowledge to adapt it to their settings. In-depth interviews and questionnaires were conducted with four purposively-selected participants from the UK (n=2), the UAE (n=1), and Iran (n=1) who had participated in the first course trial. These participants were the only volunteers from the course to participate in this case study who were willing to share their experiences since taking the course, yet they also helpfully represented a range of contexts. I had a pre-existing relationship with them, having included them in KIIs following the completion of the first MOOC trial. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were conducted with each of these participants, which included two individual interviews (approximately 30-45 minutes each held on Google Meet), a group interview with two practitioners from the same setting (approximately one hour held on Google Meet), and responses to four questionnaires (via word document). The interviews were conducted first and sought to elicit initial insights and reflections on issues regarding the impact that the course had on their perceptions and practice. These were followed by detailed questionnaires, which allowed the respondents more time to provide detailed examples of the ways in which learning from the MOOC had manifested over the two years since taking it. Interview transcripts were transferred to NVivo for coding. 45 participants submitted reflective reports as their final learning products for the third trial of the MOOC (‘The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue’), which were similarly inputted into NVivo for coding.

Top-down coding was conducted first for all data and was based on the seven key processes of knowledge mobilisation, drawing on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2000) model: production, validation, collation, dissemination, adoption, implementation and institutionalisation. Other relevant information in the data was also considered to better understand the ways in which knowledge from the course was adopted and how this impacted participants’ perceptions and practice, and course features that supported or inhibited this process. Emerging or open codes included affective aspects (for example, the use of the inquiry model and reflective activities, collaborative exercises with peers, institutional support, etc.). New findings that emerged from the analysis of the case study data were documented and compared with existing findings from previous analysis from the wider study, documenting confirmation and counter-examples throughout.

Knowledge mobilisation is used as the conceptual framework for this case study to better understand how educators reconstruct knowledge from oTPD courses. Knowledge mobilisation describes the movement of knowledge as it goes from production to being actively used. Drawing on the OECD (2000) model of knowledge mobilisation (see the below figure, which was modified from OECD, 2000), as was similarly used in Hood’s (2018) study of teachers engaging in online networks, this study takes the position that educators create new knowledge that is relevant to their context through selecting, validating, and collating information and adopting this into their knowledge base. Knowledge can then be actualised through implementation and reflection.

This case study additionally draws on teacher agency as a theoretical framework for knowledge mobilisation and takes the position that teachers who are positioned as knowledge creating professionals, and who take active responsibility in developing, testing, refining and mobilising their professional knowledge will be more likely to embed new knowledge into their practice.
Note that participant names from the reflective reports have been changed to adhere to the consent and anonymisation agreement (pseudonyms were selected in keeping with participants’ identified gender and the cultural origin of the name). Real names for the four case study respondents have been included as per their consent.

## Findings

Findings are discussed in relation to the seven phases of the knowledge mobilisation process undertaken by participants. These findings draw on and present detailed descriptions provided by the MOOC participants to provide insight into the real experiences of practitioners as they reconstructed knowledge throughout and beyond the course.

### Production

Participants described both the course materials as well as the learning shared by course peers as sources of knowledge. Participants also created knowledge products throughout the course themselves with the learning products they had to submit in order to receive a Certificate of Completion. In Course 1 these were facilitation plans, for Course 2 they were completed reports of their reflective inquiry cycles, and in Course 3 these were reflective reports. The production of knowledge therefore took place at different times and by different actors, as indicated in Figure 9.

![alt](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/img/figure9.png)

The types of knowledge products that participants found particularly valuable included practical tools and resources such as videos of teachers utilising a dialogic approach: e.g. “My practice has changed as a result of thinking and seeing examples of dialogic teaching throughout the MOOC. The videos of teachers in practice have been particularly useful” (David, reflective report). Participants also noted how these practical tools needed to be coupled with knowledge regarding the principles of dialogic practice. Diane attributed the success of the institutionalisation of the knowledge she gathered from the course to the content focusing on the principles of dialogic practice. This, she argued, resulted in knowledge becoming more transferable to other contexts: “If we’re just describing practice, it can’t be transferred” (Diane, interview transcript).

Participants also described knowledge as being generated from the collaborative nature of the course design and features that encouraged sharing perspectives and knowledge between participants. In his reflective report, Amir described this as follows:

> In as much as I gained from the course content – an understanding and insight into the fundamentals of educational dialogue, I was also able to connect with and learn from other educators from around the world. This meant that there was an excellent space created, online, through the forum, which became a collective space of reflection. This was pleasantly a mirror-image of the dialogic space we, as participant educators on the course, would hope to be able to achieve in the real world, in our classrooms.

Diane and Grace add to this and state that “the course enabled the sharing of peer to peer expertise in relation to shared resources – so it was not a case of relativist knowledge but knowledge that was co-developed in relation to material” (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire). This was also not limited to generating new knowledge through course peers, but also in conversation with colleagues in participants’ local settings. Diane and Grace worked together from the same institution and so their process of co-development was both course-wide and localised to their institution. This was similarly experienced by Amani: 

> Throughout the course, I have discussed with my team members and colleagues on what knowledge we were made available to and it really helped me with the discussions to further understand the materials and make a plan on how to utilise it in our classroom settings. Even though I was assigned a research partner, we could not coordinate due to too much time differences. So sharing with my colleagues opened up avenues for quality insights on the same content. (Amani, reflective report)

Most participants also described their desire in detail to develop localised knowledge products in order to share these with their colleagues. This was particularly the case because of the structure of the course and the reflective activities, which lent themselves to the further production of more knowledge. For example, Diane and Grace’s participation in the first trial of the course resulted in the iterative development of the following product: 

> Initially we did not have an outcome in mind, but the course enabled us to think about how to realise our learning in practice, and this motivation enabled us to craft a project. The project, revising the professional development analysis (PDA) process, has had a very positive impact on the programme. (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire)

Diane and Grace explained that the PDA is the summative assessment document that is used at the end of each teacher’s placement. They noted:

> Previously the document was descriptive and performative leading to technical articulations of teaching. After the changes that we made, the document became material to facilitate a dialogue leading to a more phonetic form of professionalism; trainees were supported in reasoning and judgement rather than recall. (Ibid)

### Validation
Knowledge validation happened at different points in time during the knowledge mobilisation process and in different ways, as articulated by participants. This is depicted below.

![alt](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/img/figure10.png) 

Validating the scholarship provided via the MOOC involved assessing the quality of the evidence shared and therefore the quality of the pedagogical model which the course strived to impart. This was discussed by participants as a time-consuming practice that they initially bypassed through seeing that the course was run by a recognised institution. As explained by Diane and Grace, the course being delivered by and content being based on research from CEDiR mattered: “What people are claiming is evidence-formed practice is really practice-informed ideology. It was important for us as an organisation that there was a scholarly community behind the course, like CEDiR” (Diane, interview transcript). This was initially misaligned with my own beliefs regarding open source resources and allowing participants to control the learning environment; however, this also made sense because of teachers’ limited availability to research which courses are high quality. 

Once they were enrolled, the validation process occurred again, often through the reflection of content as it related to their beliefs and understandings. For example, Zahra notes in her reflective report that the assigned readings helped her “reflect about the ideology of how the environment would be where everyone will be working on a level of self actualization. I could relate it with the teaching methodology of the Prophet Muhammad (PBuH).” She continues this thought later in the reflective report by adding: “While going through the writings of Wegerif, one idea which was constantly coming in my mind was that it beautifully relates to the ideology given by Quran and Islam.” This relates to Ahmed and Qassim’s (forthcoming) guide for educators, which offers Islamic Dialogic Moves to extend and complement T-SEDA for use within the global Islamic Educator Learning Community on Camtree. 

Similarly, Ali (based in Afghanistan) noted in his reflective report that:

> Decolonising education is important to me because education is not a one-way street and requires dialogue… I can clearly say that in the educational system of my country, none of the officials and subordinates pay attention to the importance of decolonising dialogue. 

Ali validated the knowledge through his experience, which interestingly in this case was in opposition to the dominant pedagogy in his setting.

Participants also described how the validation process itself contributed to contextualisation and greater understanding. For example, in his reflective report Amir notes: “Thinking about, understanding, but most of all communicating this with others about these concepts has really helped me to advance my thinking and practice.” This points to an important role in collaboration and communication within the validation process, and how this can enhance or potentially inhibit it.

Interestingly, the use of validation as a dialogic tool also became a part of the changing practices of teachers. For example, in his reflective report Yousuf mentions that he leveraged learning from the Fundamentals MOOC to select exercises in which his students also validated knowledge products and one another’s contributions.

### Collation

Similar to the validation phase, collating knowledge appeared to be influenced by teachers’ beliefs and their positionality. The course itself collated knowledge products for the learners, which I recognise was shaped by the social and cultural underpinnings of my research, my positionality and the aims of the course.

Participants agreed that courses should offer scaffolding that provides different resources and levels of support for participants, depending on their settings, interests, and aims. Participants should be able to select resources that are most relevant to them. Within all reflective reports submitted, participants were able to articulate the areas of dialogue and the associated knowledge products from the course that were the most interesting to them and relevant to their settings. This indicates that participants are highly capable of selecting the readings and resources that have the highest potential of influencing their practice. Giving teachers support and agency to undertake this process themselves was critical. In his reflective report, Amir explains the collation of relevant knowledge as being strengthened through the course’s structure:

> I better understand the value of dialogue as a teaching and learning method, especially within my subject area of the Social Sciences. It is interesting to note that this is what I intended to gain, but I am pleasantly surprised by how much I gained this from others’ teaching in other subject areas; as well as from the course content that I understood as applicable to my subject specialisms.

This shows how collation was influenced by the course content as well as his course peers via collaborative activities and the discussion forum. Related to this, collation also involved the products that teachers selected to share with their colleagues. In the facilitator’s course, course activities included support for participants to collate relevant resources that they planned to share with their colleagues in their settings.

### Dissemination

Knowledge dissemination involved the sharing of the knowledge products via the course content and collaborative activities, as well as how the practitioners shared knowledge with their colleagues. It became clear that knowledge dissemination was impacted by the previous phases. For example, the formation of the knowledge products and the ways in which they were validated and collated undeniably affected how they were then disseminated, including to whom and how.

Knowledge was disseminated via the course structure through videos, readings, tools and professional resources. Participants described particularly effective elements as: (i) having a clear focus for each week with associated readings and resources; (ii) having a timeline in which to review this knowledge to ensure that there was accountability and momentum; and (iii) utilising a dialogic approach for dissemination. Knowledge was also disseminated through the course via the discussion forum and other collaborative exchanges between peers such as live events and the research buddy programme. As Amir stated in his reflective report, “I was able to learn from other participants through the online forum, and to read about their thinking, understanding and practice.” Diane and Grace added: “it was also beneficial to share with others from different jurisdictions – the sense of community gave an energy to our work” (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire). However, this also meant that it was not possible for some individuals to access this knowledge; for example, if they encountered language or technical barriers to engage meaningfully in the collaborative elements of the course. In their responses to the case study questionnaire, Sarah and Ghasem both noted that they faced challenges connecting with other learners, which was echoed in the wider data (as identified in Chapter 5 and Case Study 3).

Related to dissemination via course peers, most participants in their reflective reports articulated a desire to share their learning with their colleagues. The case study respondents who had taken the facilitator’s course also had considered their own dissemination of knowledge in great detail. Here is a sample of quotes from participants regarding their planned dissemination activities:

![alt](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/img/figure11.png)

Participants also reflected on challenges regarding disseminating knowledge to their colleagues, which often included time constraints and cultural misalignment. For example, in her reflective report Mia noted:

I have tried sharing what I have learned with my colleagues. However, not one has been interested in experimenting, let alone to talk about it. I feel teachers right now are incredibly overwhelmed and it is hard for them to try something new in this state of mind.

The role of the local facilitator and the accompanying resources in the facilitator’s course can go some way toward mitigating this. As Sarah explained,

> I was well-versed in dialogic learning and teaching but had been trying to forge my own path in leading oracy across the school and trying to get time-poor colleagues to focus on research within their own classrooms. The [facilitator’s] course provided me with a clear approach to facilitating departmental oracy leads’ dialogic approaches to learning and teaching. (Sarah, case study questionnaire)

Participants also reflected on the role of oTPD as a unique knowledge dissemination tool. As articulated by Diane, “I will access it [oTPD] for knowledge that is not locally available, or to engage with international communities.” The structure in which knowledge was disseminated was also particularly impactful. Diane adds:

> I would welcome a more dialogic approach rather than tips and tricks. I would welcome CPD that is framed by professional concepts rather than atomised content. The singularity and 1:1 correspondences of some current training in the English context is very reductive. (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire)

### Adoption

Educators need a reason to adopt disseminated knowledge into their thought processes (OECD, 2000). They will not automatically invite new knowledge into their ways of thinking if they do not have buy-in or motivation to do so. The adoption of knowledge from the MOOC was therefore a result of the careful collation of knowledge products, the dissemination process, as well as individuals’ motivations for engaging in the course. Motivation was critical for this phase, with participants noting that strong connections they had to the course content were made because of areas of personal or professional interest. As mentioned in findings related to knowledge validation, the adoption of new knowledge was enhanced through relating it to an individual’s beliefs and setting. For example, in his reflective report Amir described the knowledge that was relevant to the religious institutions in which he worked:

> I am also interested to encourage those in religious institutions (especially Madrassah’s – Islamic religious schools) to learn from and adopt the practice of educational dialogue. I think this could really encourage young learners to develop into adults that are at home in society more, being who they are and want to be.

Knowledge adoption also involved considerable reflection. In her reflective report Hannah explained: “I delved into areas that I thought I knew about, but soon realised I had partial understandings about or that I had studied these ideas from a single perspective; now I was exploring them from multiple lenses.” Diane and Grace similarly described their reflections regarding the knowledge from the facilitator’s course: “We realised we were being inauthentic. We weren’t modelling professional expectations in our approach – dissonance there. Because we felt beholden to accreditation.” (Diane and Grace, interview transcript)

Collaboration with peers within the oTPD course as well as those within institutions strengthened the knowledge adoption phase as well. In her reflective report, Isra noted: “I found some of the forums beneficial in grasping the material and hearing new ideas. For instance, I am planning on trying one of the activities a participant shared.” Diane and Grace worked together from the same institution and recommended: “I think that wherever possible, involving more than one person from each institution to enable off-line as well as on-line developments” (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire). They argued that this resulted in an easier time contextualising the course materials and transferring the knowledge and principles to their setting.

### Implementation

Similar to the above phases, adopting knowledge does not mean that it will automatically be implemented into teachers’ professional practices. As articulated in the OECD (2000) report on knowledge mobilisation, “adoption is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for the application of new knowledge or practice. Adoption involves a willingness to change, but a wide range of barriers may impede successful implementation” (p. 40). The findings indicate that implementing new knowledge is strengthened through practical resources that can be easily localised, having institutional support including time available for this, and opportunities to collaborate with colleagues.

The tools and resources from the course offered participants a structure in which to implement knowledge. Many participants described setting up ground rules for talk in their settings, for example. As Zahra noted in her reflective report: “I used all of the teaching repertoires in my lessons to some extent but there’s a lot more structure and purpose.” Amir similarly noted: “The course has also given me a range of tools to be able to access and experiment with. This feels really empowering” (Amir, reflective report). Sarah added: “The T-SEDA templates pack was invaluable and I adapted it to suit our environment and the limited timeframe that the staff were working within” (Sarah, case study questionnaire).

Having institutional support and creating buy-in for the approach were also important for the implementation of new knowledge. Teachers had to have time to be able to dedicate to this, and have access to support networks to create accountability and maintain momentum. Interestingly, however, a few practitioners from contexts that they described as not aligned with dialogic pedagogy have made strides to overcome this challenge. For example, Ghasem continued to share his learning with his colleagues even though he noted that there was little interest from his colleagues or institutional leadership (Ghasem, interview transcript). In his reflective report Elijah similarly explained: “I come from a region in Nigeria where our teaching is centred on the teacher rather than the students. But I have learnt to involve my students in their own learning and create a dialogic space that supports them to think creatively.”

Involving the learners in knowledge implementation appeared to also be beneficial. For example, David works in a Higher Education institution in Australia and noted:

> I shared Mercer’s breakdown with my students and had them reflect on their latest group discussion and asked them to describe the quality of their talk. Most agreed that their talk group was cumulative in nature. We then discussed ways to encourage exploratory talk in their following group discussion. (David, reflective report)

Implementation appeared to also be strengthened through the use of a dialogic approach. As Lina noted in her reflective report, “I networked and interacted with colleagues from other settings and countries discussing the impact and strategies of implementation”. Isra similarly noted: “I found some of the forums beneficial in grasping the material and hearing new ideas. For instance, I am planning on trying one of the activities a participant shared” (Isra, reflective report).

Importantly, participants were able to articulate what worked well and which challenges or barriers remained for the implementation of their new knowledge. For example, David reflected: “If I think about it now, I could have done more to foreground the importance of exploratory talk at the start of the unit – especially given the unit is on critical and creative thinking in education” (David, reflective report). Zahra similarly assessed her implementation of the knowledge in her reflective report:

> Individual (student pair) works really well in maths and Arabic lessons. Group (student led) needs to be developed further. I think with the regular follow up of ground rules for the talk is something I need to do more often to make grouping repertoire work better.

### Institutionalisation

Institutionalisation involves knowledge becoming a “sustained, routine practice that is accepted as ‘normal’” (OECD, 2000, p. 40). This is likely the most complex phase in the knowledge mobilisation process and the most difficult to assess. However, because of the reflective nature of the course content and the final learning products submitted, participants were well equipped to describe the ways in which they had embedded the knowledge they had gained into their routine practice and how they planned to do this.

There was a clear recognition of the importance of the role of the local facilitator for this phase of the knowledge mobilisation process. Participants recognised the need to have institutional-level support in order to embed knowledge, and planned to instigate this themselves where it did not exist. For example, Ava wrote in her reflective report that she planned to: “collect experiences in order to be able to share these approaches with colleagues and possibly also facilitate their implementation on a larger scale in my institution.” Participants also noted that building confidence through the acquisition of knowledge regarding the fundamental theories behind educational dialogue was critical in bringing that knowledge to their colleagues.

Factors that appeared to influence the knowledge embedding process included providing enough structure to ensure that dialogic pedagogy was promoted but not so much structure that it does not allow for agency and creativity. This echoes Design Principle 2 in Chapter 5.1. Participants from the facilitator’s course also recommended that change never be imposed, but rather everyone has a role in the knowledge mobilisation process. Diane and Grace also mentioned the importance of managing expectations for themselves and their colleagues regarding how change manifests, as this is not a quick or simple process:

> This isn’t a quick fix – sometimes in education we’ve been tempted to go for quick fixes. This is an investment – it’s a way of being. Not a quick fix and not right for every aspect of your work – have to be quite discerning. Goes back to authenticity.  Also sometimes we have to be instructional and actually didactically teaching it’s the best way. (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire)

This notion was shared by Christina in her reflective report who recognised that adapting practice was an ongoing endeavour: “As the course progressed, I started thinking about how to turn teacher-led learning activities into more student-centred ones. This will be an on-going exercise.”

Further strategies shared by participants to encourage institutionalisation were engaging different support networks to promote buy-in to the approach, since buy-in is necessary to adopt new learning into practice. These included colleagues as well as parents and community members. Diane and Grace explained that their summer term meeting was “pivotal” where “tutors became co-researchers with us” (Diane and Grace, interview transcript). Ghasem noted the importance of involving parents from his secondary school setting. He argued “parents are very important for dialogic teaching because classroom dialogue should be continued at home” (Ghasem, case study questionnaire). This also resulted in parents providing his school leadership with positive feedback that he hoped would contribute to a wider interest in adopting the pedagogy. In his reflective report, Zahid similarly described his plans to:

> Engage parents and other community members to support students’ learning through the community’s existing or indigenous knowledge to solve problems through dialogue. This is also a process of decolonization and promotion of indigenous knowledge.

Having the course structured to encourage deep reflection was also noted by participants as encouraging embedding knowledge from the course into their practice. Sarah explained: “I did enter more of a dialogue with myself on a weekly basis and enjoyed the diagnostic and reflective approach to my practice and role as a facilitator that was fostered by the course materials and tasks set” (Sarah, case study questionnaire). This is also touched on by David in his reflective report:

> One of the most profound impacts has been on the way I think about teaching and learning in light of learning about the dialogic stance. This concept has reshaped the ethos of my classroom from one of direct, top-down instruction to one of collective inquiry and shared ownership of knowledge.

This suggests that a focus on the concepts and fundamental theories of those concepts, coupled with opportunities for reflection and dialogue encouraged participants to embed that knowledge more easily. This reflective process was also noted by participants as itself a component of the knowledge institutionalisation process that should continue. For example, David explained in his reflective report that he also has “embedded much more reflection time into my teaching to allow personal insights and indeed questions to crystalize in the minds of students in relation to the overarching question. As a result, I have noticed a sense of collegiality in the group and a willingness to talk openly about the challenges and opportunities faced in education.”

Incorporating dialogic approaches for when teachers in the institution share knowledge and access further professional development was also considered important for embedding the knowledge as well. In her reflective report, Isra (based in Turkey) described this regarding her setting:

> Most professional development sessions are one-shot programs where guest speakers share their knowledge on a topic. Teachers are mostly passive listeners and do not enjoy such sessions. Incorporating techniques from dialogic teaching and creating dialogic space will help teachers learn from each other. If done regularly, I think such sessions will also motivate teachers to engage in dialogue outside of professional development sessions. It may help engender a culture of sharing and co-constructing knowledge.

The four case study respondents who had taken the facilitator’s course described knowledge institutionalisation as first requiring their own development of knowledge products. This was particularly successful in the case of Diane and Grace, who described how they were still using the tool they developed after the MOOC two and a half years later. This suggests that in order for knowledge to be embedded in practice, local facilitators must undertake their own phases of knowledge mobilisation: producing relevant products that can be easily validated by colleagues, collating the evidence they planned to share with their colleagues, disseminating this knowledge in meaningful ways for them to be adopted into their colleagues’ knowledge base, thereby enabling their colleagues to implement and embed these shifts in their own perceptions and practice. For example, Sarah utilised the reflective cycle from T-SEDA to frame her work with the teachers in her setting: 

> The pack was well-received by colleagues. It provided scaffolding as needed and access to key resources that they could choose to explore if they wanted to. I was then able to meet with colleagues to discuss their projects individually, using the pack to facilitate discussions about progress, methodology and impact. Each teacher was also paired with a ‘research partner’ within the group to bounce ideas off and act as a critical friend throughout their cycle, providing a second support structure from those undergoing the same process of reflective research. All staff completed posters at the end using a template I designed based on the T-SEDA cycle that summarised their reflective cycle and these were displayed alongside departmental work on oracy/SoL at our Festival of Sharing in June 2021. (Sarah, case study questionnaire)

This suggests that the model of facilitation can also lend itself to facilitators’ colleagues engaging in their own process of knowledge mobilisation, as presented below:

![alt](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/img/figure12.png)

Challenges associated with institutionalisation included losing momentum with colleagues over time. For example, Sarah reflected:

> I felt that I started the cycles off strongly, drawing staff together regularly through working lunches and in staff training slots, but as the cycles evolved time pressures in school impacted the regularity of meetings and the cycles became more independent due to the lack of time that could be devoted to a more hands-on facilitation. In many ways, the pack mitigated this by providing remote support and colleagues did utilise their research partners effectively too. The cycles were impactful in so far as they enabled staff to reflect, diagnose, action and reflect again upon their dialogic practice, but we have not repeated them due to other internal foci and the time that they demanded from colleagues with many other regulatory and academic pressures upon them. (Sarah, case study questionnaire)

To mitigate this, Ghasem noted the importance of a community of practice to lean on for support and motivation, particularly when there is no institutional interest in the pedagogy. He argued that this should be a communal online space where “teachers can talk to others about their problems and seek solutions” and importantly recommends that this community incorporate a dialogic culture: “we need a dialogic atmosphere or dialogue space between teachers in the world” (Ghasem, case study questionnaire).

## Discussion

_RQ1: How did participants reconstruct the knowledge from the MOOC in order to adapt it to their local settings?_

The findings suggest that the knowledge reconstruction process was not linear and was influenced by a number of factors. This is supported by Levin (2008) who described the relationship between knowledge and use as bidirectional: “practice affects research just as research affects practice” (p. 8). While the process was multidimensional and complex and involved the unique social and cultural environment of the individual, their institution, and wider context, there were cross-cutting themes to highlight regarding this process.

Participants reconstructed knowledge from the course content and their peers through reflecting on its applicability to their settings and the alignment with their beliefs and practice. This substantiates Hood’s (2018) research in which she argued the following: 

>Teachers’ prior knowledge and beliefs, including their personal interpretations of teaching and learning, their values, past experiences and their school and organisational context, all combine to influence how they assess and utilise a resource. (p. 599)

Participants also brought in alternative perspectives through course peers or their colleagues as part of this reconstruction process. This dialogic component of the knowledge reconstruction process was pivotal for participants to move from adopting the knowledge from the MOOC to implementing it in their practice, and disseminating it to their colleagues.  

_RQ2: How did this knowledge reconstruction process impact participants’ perceptions and practices?_

The knowledge reconstruction process deeply influenced the level of impact seen on participants’ perceptions and practices. Those participants who were able to collaboratively reconstruct knowledge appeared to have higher levels of documented impact on their practice. This was particularly the case for Diane and Grace who saw immense success from their research collaboration and tool co-design. Levin (2008) noted that “personal contact and interaction remains the most powerful vehicle for moving evidence into practice” (p. 8). This is opposed to knowledge mobilisation being focused on providing teachers with reports or other similar research products (Ibid). Having tools that provide the pedagogical principles with easily adapted practical outputs are helpful, but including methods to discuss these tools with others and incorporate their knowledge can make them much more impactful.

It is also important to note the varied barriers to knowledge mobilisation. This was most often cited by participants as their availability to undertake the process, lack of institutional support and alignment, inability to access the collaborative features of the course, and a lack of interest and buy-in amongst colleagues. Interestingly, while wider barriers from the literature include a lack of sufficient high quality evidence and unavailability of that evidence (Levin, 2008), course participants cited this collated knowledge as a strength of the course and a strength of oTPD more widely because of its potential reach and ease with which to collate and filter materials.

_RQ3: Which course and design factors influenced changes in perceptions and practices?_

There were commonly referenced features from the course design that appeared to influence the ways in which participants engaged in the knowledge mobilisation process. For example, the use of reflective exercises for participants to engage in consistent deep reflection, documenting positionality, offering opportunities for meaningful collaboration with peers, and promoting the model of local facilitation to encourage institutional buy-in and support. In addition, having dialogic pedagogy as the fundamental concept in which the MOOC series engaged particularly lent itself to the knowledge mobilisation process. Zahra referenced the literature in her reflective report regarding this: “According to Wegerif the dialogic space is a shared space where ideas can resonate together, merge in some ways, clash in some ways and ultimately stimulate new ideas.” Diane added: “Dialogue is a way of structuring professional knowledge” (interview transcript). 

The structure of the course also connects with teacher agency and retaining autonomy through the knowledge mobilisation process. While courses can structure activities and exercises that encourage reflection, it is recommended that this is done under the framework of teacher agency and empowerment and scaffolding is provided for support.

## Conclusions

This case study sought to contribute towards a better understanding of how educators reconstruct knowledge from oTPD (RQ1) and how this impacts their perspectives and practices (RQ2). The findings indicate that educators go through a complex process of knowledge reconstruction that is deeply affected by their social and cultural background and setting. The findings also suggest that this process is strengthened through consistent reflection, a dialogic approach and opportunities for collaboration with peers, and institutional support. This has implications for course designers and facilitators in recognising these factors that influence the knowledge mobilisation process (RQ3), and in providing: (i) activities that encourage reflection and collaboration; (ii) practical tools and resources that are easily adapted to different contexts; and (iii) opportunities for local facilitators to take on a leadership role within their institution to promote buy-in.

While this study was able to provide an overview of the ways in which participants engaged in the knowledge mobilisation process within the MOOC, the scope of the study meant that it was unable to capture the complexity of the knowledge mobilisation process in full. Indeed, the circumstances under which our sector generates new knowledge and the uptake by teachers stands to be significantly better understood. The findings make it clear that knowledge mobilisation is not a one-way, linear process and the multidimensional and highly contextual affective factors make it challenging to generalise findings. Limitations for this case study also included the limited scope of perspectives included in the data collection and further research would benefit from more detailed experiences following oTPD participants after they have had time to reconstruct knowledge from the course.

Further research should also seek better understanding of the resources and infrastructure needed to support more effective knowledge mobilisation for teachers as it relates to oTPD. This is particularly necessary for contexts in which teachers engage with and reconstruct knowledge that does not align with their existing practice or beliefs (or that of their institutions). Lastly, more research regarding researching knowledge mobilisation is needed including the methodologies and considerations for investigating these processes.
