## Case studies

This chapter presents three case studies, which explore the local impact of the MOOC, educators’ perceptions and experiences of oTPD, and the reach and equitable access of oTPD. The case studies are presented in a similar way to the previous findings and discussion chapter for consistency of style. A background section is provided for each which includes related literature, followed by the studies’ aims and methods, and then associated findings are presented and discussed. The case studies all conclude with implications for practice and recommendations for future research.
6.1. Case study 1: Local impact of a global MOOC
6.1.1. Overview
This case study was developed in order to explore the impact of the MOOC on participants’ perceptions and practice, particularly considering the different ways this manifested in varied contexts. Leveraging the part-time nature of the PhD, this case study was used to follow up with participants two years after taking the first MOOC trial. This built on the findings articulated in Chapter 5 and included additional KIIs and questionnaires with four participants based in three different countries: the United Kingdom (UK), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran. In addition, this study drew on an analysis of the 45 reflective reports submitted as final learning products for the third MOOC trial in order to explore other features of impact.
6.1.2. Background
As online professional learning opportunities have become increasingly available, so too have opportunities for educators to leverage the course content as well as the online networks created as part of these courses to access new knowledge. However, knowledge alone cannot change practice (Levin, 2008) and teachers go through a complex process of reconstructing new knowledge before it can manifest in change to their perceptions and practice (if at all).
The wider study sought to build a course that went beyond a six-week programme and convene a community of practice in which educators could continue to share insights, practice and resources with one another. These types of networks that promote collaboration and sharing between teachers as a way to support their professional development have been associated with improvements in student learning outcomes (e.g. see Katz & Earl, 2010). In addition, oTPD courses and online knowledge sharing platforms provide educators with more control and agency to select learning opportunities that are most relevant to their interests and settings (Dede 2000), share resources and insights, and to reflect on their practice (Wesely 2013). This can enable more efficient knowledge mobilisation processes for educators to transfer new knowledge into their practice and potentially also disseminate this knowledge to their peers.
Levin (2008) argues that knowledge mobilisation has become a more significant focus in the sector (in all sectors, in fact), which has only been enhanced since the time of his writing by technology and internet-mediated learning opportunities that potentially have a significantly wider reach to create and share new knowledge. However, it is also clear that knowledge and practice are deeply intertwined with social and cultural factors. Levin (2008) states that “knowledge takes shape and has effect in a wide variety of ways, but is always mediated through various social and political processes” (p. 8). This means that there is no simple and generalisable pathway for educators pursuing oTPD to turn new knowledge into new practice, which is particularly the case in an international MOOC with participants from highly varied settings. There is also a risk that because of challenges with adopting resources to make them more relevant for local settings, teachers may favour resources that reinforce their existing perceptions and practices rather than ones that might reorient them (Hood, 2018).
In their review of the literature on oTPD, Dede et al. (2009) found that few studies sought to measure how educators make sense of new knowledge or how they apply it in their practice. As oTPD opportunities continue to grow, more evidence is needed regarding the phases of knowledge mobilisation beyond the production of more knowledge through oTPD and their associated online networks. This includes an understanding of the mediating factors that influence the knowledge mobilisation process.
6.1.3. Aims
This case study explores the ways in which the MOOC affected participants’ perceptions and practice. While the wider study examined the impact of the course at a broad level, it did not collect data on how participants reconstructed the knowledge shared via course content and others’ contributions in order to adapt it to their own contexts. This case study therefore asks three questions that have guided the research:
RQ1: How did participants reconstruct the knowledge from the MOOC in order to adapt it to their local settings?
RQ2: How did this knowledge reconstruction process impact participants’ perceptions and practices?
RQ3: Which course and design factors influenced changes in perceptions and practices?
It was the objective of this case study to contribute towards a better understanding of how educators reconstruct and use knowledge from oTPD and how this impacts their perspectives and practice, including whether new knowledge has been embedded and new practice can be sustained. This has implications for course designers and facilitators in recognising and designing for the factors that influence the knowledge mobilisation process.
6.1.4. Methods
This case study builds on findings from the wider study, particularly those discussed in Chapter 5.2 regarding shifts in participants’ perceptions and practices. Case study methodology (Hamilton, 2011) was utilised to explore the above research questions regarding the ways in which oTPD participants reconstruct knowledge to adapt it to their settings. In-depth interviews and questionnaires were conducted with four purposively-selected participants from the UK (n=2), the UAE (n=1), and Iran (n=1) who had participated in the first course trial. These participants were the only volunteers from the course to participate in this case study who were willing to share their experiences since taking the course, yet they also helpfully represented a range of contexts. I had a pre-existing relationship with them, having included them in KIIs following the completion of the first MOOC trial. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were conducted with each of these participants, which included two individual interviews (approximately 30-45 minutes each held on Google Meet), a group interview with two practitioners from the same setting (approximately one hour held on Google Meet), and responses to four questionnaires (via word document). The interviews were conducted first and sought to elicit initial insights and reflections on issues regarding the impact that the course had on their perceptions and practice. These were followed by detailed questionnaires, which allowed the respondents more time to provide detailed examples of the ways in which learning from the MOOC had manifested over the two years since taking it. Interview transcripts were transferred to NVivo for coding. 45 participants submitted reflective reports as their final learning products for the third trial of the MOOC (‘The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue’), which were similarly inputted into NVivo for coding.
Top-down coding was conducted first for all data and was based on the seven key processes of knowledge mobilisation, drawing on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2000) model: production, validation, collation, dissemination, adoption, implementation and institutionalisation. Other relevant information in the data was also considered to better understand the ways in which knowledge from the course was adopted and how this impacted participants’ perceptions and practice, and course features that supported or inhibited this process. Emerging or open codes included affective aspects (for example, the use of the inquiry model and reflective activities, collaborative exercises with peers, institutional support, etc.). New findings that emerged from the analysis of the case study data were documented and compared with existing findings from previous analysis from the wider study, documenting confirmation and counter-examples throughout.
Knowledge mobilisation is used as the conceptual framework for this case study to better understand how educators reconstruct knowledge from oTPD courses. Knowledge mobilisation describes the movement of knowledge as it goes from production to being actively used. Drawing on the OECD (2000) model of knowledge mobilisation (see Figure 8), as was similarly used in Hood’s (2018) study of teachers engaging in online networks, this study takes the position that educators create new knowledge that is relevant to their context through selecting, validating, and collating information and adopting this into their knowledge base. Knowledge can then be actualised through implementation and reflection.

 
Figure 8: Phases of knowledge mobilisation, modified from OECD (2000)
This case study additionally draws on teacher agency as a theoretical framework for knowledge mobilisation and takes the position that teachers who are positioned as knowledge creating professionals, and who take active responsibility in developing, testing, refining and mobilising their professional knowledge will be more likely to embed new knowledge into their practice.

6.1.5. Findings
Findings are discussed in relation to the seven phases of the knowledge mobilisation process undertaken by participants. These findings draw on and present detailed descriptions provided by the MOOC participants to provide insight into the real experiences of practitioners as they reconstructed knowledge throughout and beyond the course.
Production
Participants described both the course materials as well as the learning shared by course peers as sources of knowledge. Participants also created knowledge products throughout the course themselves with the learning products they had to submit in order to receive a Certificate of Completion. In Course 1 these were facilitation plans, for Course 2 they were completed reports of their reflective inquiry cycles, and in Course 3 these were reflective reports. The production of knowledge therefore took place at different times and by different actors, as indicated in Figure 9.

 
Figure 9: Knowledge production within and beyond the course

The types of knowledge products that participants found particularly valuable included practical tools and resources such as videos of teachers utilising a dialogic approach: e.g. “My practice has changed as a result of thinking and seeing examples of dialogic teaching throughout the MOOC. The videos of teachers in practice have been particularly useful” (David, reflective report). Participants also noted how these practical tools needed to be coupled with knowledge regarding the principles of dialogic practice. Diane attributed the success of the institutionalisation of the knowledge she gathered from the course to the content focusing on the principles of dialogic practice. This, she argued, resulted in knowledge becoming more transferable to other contexts: “If we’re just describing practice, it can’t be transferred” (Diane, interview transcript).
Participants also described knowledge as being generated from the collaborative nature of the course design and features that encouraged sharing perspectives and knowledge between participants. In his reflective report, Amir described this as follows:
In as much as I gained from the course content – an understanding and insight into the fundamentals of educational dialogue, I was also able to connect with and learn from other educators from around the world. This meant that there was an excellent space created, online, through the forum, which became a collective space of reflection. This was pleasantly a mirror-image of the dialogic space we, as participant educators on the course, would hope to be able to achieve in the real world, in our classrooms.
Diane and Grace add to this and state that “the course enabled the sharing of peer to peer expertise in relation to shared resources – so it was not a case of relativist knowledge but knowledge that was co-developed in relation to material” (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire). This was also not limited to generating new knowledge through course peers, but also in conversation with colleagues in participants’ local settings. Diane and Grace worked together from the same institution and so their process of co-development was both course-wide and localised to their institution. This was similarly experienced by Amani: 
Throughout the course, I have discussed with my team members and colleagues on what knowledge we were made available to and it really helped me with the discussions to further understand the materials and make a plan on how to utilise it in our classroom settings. Even though I was assigned a research partner, we could not coordinate due to too much time differences. So sharing with my colleagues opened up avenues for quality insights on the same content. (Amani, reflective report)
Most participants also described their desire in detail to develop localised knowledge products in order to share these with their colleagues. This was particularly the case because of the structure of the course and the reflective activities, which lent themselves to the further production of more knowledge. For example, Diane and Grace’s participation in the first trial of the course resulted in the iterative development of the following product: 
Initially we did not have an outcome in mind, but the course enabled us to think about how to realise our learning in practice, and this motivation enabled us to craft a project. The project, revising the professional development analysis (PDA) process, has had a very positive impact on the programme. (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire)
Diane and Grace explained that the PDA is the summative assessment document that is used at the end of each teacher’s placement. They noted:
Previously the document was descriptive and performative leading to technical articulations of teaching. After the changes that we made, the document became material to facilitate a dialogue leading to a more phonetic form of professionalism; trainees were supported in reasoning and judgement rather than recall. (Ibid)
Validation
Knowledge validation happened at different points in time during the knowledge mobilisation process and in different ways, as articulated by participants. This is depicted in Figure 10.

 
Figure 10: Methods of validating new knowledge

Validating the scholarship provided via the MOOC involved assessing the quality of the evidence shared and therefore the quality of the pedagogical model which the course strived to impart. This was discussed by participants as a time-consuming practice that they initially bypassed through seeing that the course was run by a recognised institution. As explained by Diane and Grace, the course being delivered by and content being based on research from CEDiR mattered: “What people are claiming is evidence-formed practice is really practice-informed ideology. It was important for us as an organisation that there was a scholarly community behind the course, like CEDiR” (Diane, interview transcript). This was initially misaligned with my own beliefs regarding open source resources and allowing participants to control the learning environment; however, this also made sense because of teachers’ limited availability to research which courses are high quality. 
Once they were enrolled, the validation process occurred again, often through the reflection of content as it related to their beliefs and understandings. For example, Zahra notes in her reflective report that the assigned readings helped her “reflect about the ideology of how the environment would be where everyone will be working on a level of self actualization. I could relate it with the teaching methodology of the Prophet Muhammad (PBuH).” She continues this thought later in the reflective report by adding: “While going through the writings of Wegerif, one idea which was constantly coming in my mind was that it beautifully relates to the ideology given by Quran and Islam.” This relates to Ahmed and Qassim’s (forthcoming) guide for educators, which offers Islamic Dialogic Moves to extend and complement T-SEDA for use within the global Islamic Educator Learning Community on Camtree. 
Similarly, Ali (based in Afghanistan) noted in his reflective report that:
Decolonising education is important to me because education is not a one-way street and requires dialogue… I can clearly say that in the educational system of my country, none of the officials and subordinates pay attention to the importance of decolonising dialogue. 
Ali validated the knowledge through his experience, which interestingly in this case was in opposition to the dominant pedagogy in his setting.
Participants also described how the validation process itself contributed to contextualisation and greater understanding. For example, in his reflective report Amir notes: “Thinking about, understanding, but most of all communicating this with others about these concepts has really helped me to advance my thinking and practice.” This points to an important role in collaboration and communication within the validation process, and how this can enhance or potentially inhibit it.
Interestingly, the use of validation as a dialogic tool also became a part of the changing practices of teachers. For example, in his reflective report Yousuf mentions that he leveraged learning from the Fundamentals MOOC to select exercises in which his students also validated knowledge products and one another’s contributions.
Collation
Similar to the validation phase, collating knowledge appeared to be influenced by teachers’ beliefs and their positionality. The course itself collated knowledge products for the learners, which I recognise was shaped by the social and cultural underpinnings of my research, my positionality and the aims of the course.
Participants agreed that courses should offer scaffolding that provides different resources and levels of support for participants, depending on their settings, interests, and aims. Participants should be able to select resources that are most relevant to them. Within all reflective reports submitted, participants were able to articulate the areas of dialogue and the associated knowledge products from the course that were the most interesting to them and relevant to their settings. This indicates that participants are highly capable of selecting the readings and resources that have the highest potential of influencing their practice. Giving teachers support and agency to undertake this process themselves was critical. In his reflective report, Amir explains the collation of relevant knowledge as being strengthened through the course’s structure:
I better understand the value of dialogue as a teaching and learning method, especially within my subject area of the Social Sciences. It is interesting to note that this is what I intended to gain, but I am pleasantly surprised by how much I gained this from others’ teaching in other subject areas; as well as from the course content that I understood as applicable to my subject specialisms.
This shows how collation was influenced by the course content as well as his course peers via collaborative activities and the discussion forum. Related to this, collation also involved the products that teachers selected to share with their colleagues. In the facilitator’s course, course activities included support for participants to collate relevant resources that they planned to share with their colleagues in their settings.
Dissemination
Knowledge dissemination involved the sharing of the knowledge products via the course content and collaborative activities, as well as how the practitioners shared knowledge with their colleagues. It became clear that knowledge dissemination was impacted by the previous phases. For example, the formation of the knowledge products and the ways in which they were validated and collated undeniably affected how they were then disseminated, including to whom and how.
Knowledge was disseminated via the course structure through videos, readings, tools and professional resources. Participants described particularly effective elements as: (i) having a clear focus for each week with associated readings and resources; (ii) having a timeline in which to review this knowledge to ensure that there was accountability and momentum; and (iii) utilising a dialogic approach for dissemination. Knowledge was also disseminated through the course via the discussion forum and other collaborative exchanges between peers such as live events and the research buddy programme. As Amir stated in his reflective report, “I was able to learn from other participants through the online forum, and to read about their thinking, understanding and practice.” Diane and Grace added: “it was also beneficial to share with others from different jurisdictions – the sense of community gave an energy to our work” (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire). However, this also meant that it was not possible for some individuals to access this knowledge; for example, if they encountered language or technical barriers to engage meaningfully in the collaborative elements of the course. In their responses to the case study questionnaire, Sarah and Ghasem both noted that they faced challenges connecting with other learners, which was echoed in the wider data (as identified in Chapter 5 and Case Study 3).
Related to dissemination via course peers, most participants in their reflective reports articulated a desire to share their learning with their colleagues. The case study respondents who had taken the facilitator’s course also had considered their own dissemination of knowledge in great detail. Figure 11 presents a sample of quotes from participants regarding their planned dissemination activities.
 
Figure 11: Quotes from participants regarding their planned dissemination activities
Participants also reflected on challenges regarding disseminating knowledge to their colleagues, which often included time constraints and cultural misalignment. For example, in her reflective report Mia noted:
I have tried sharing what I have learned with my colleagues. However, not one has been interested in experimenting, let alone to talk about it. I feel teachers right now are incredibly overwhelmed and it is hard for them to try something new in this state of mind.
The role of the local facilitator and the accompanying resources in the facilitator’s course can go some way toward mitigating this. As Sarah explained,
I was well-versed in dialogic learning and teaching but had been trying to forge my own path in leading oracy across the school and trying to get time-poor colleagues to focus on research within their own classrooms. The [facilitator’s] course provided me with a clear approach to facilitating departmental oracy leads’ dialogic approaches to learning and teaching. (Sarah, case study questionnaire)
Participants also reflected on the role of oTPD as a unique knowledge dissemination tool. As articulated by Diane, “I will access it [oTPD] for knowledge that is not locally available, or to engage with international communities.” The structure in which knowledge was disseminated was also particularly impactful. Diane adds:
I would welcome a more dialogic approach rather than tips and tricks. I would welcome CPD that is framed by professional concepts rather than atomised content. The singularity and 1:1 correspondences of some current training in the English context is very reductive. (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire)
Adoption
Educators need a reason to adopt disseminated knowledge into their thought processes (OECD, 2000). They will not automatically invite new knowledge into their ways of thinking if they do not have buy-in or motivation to do so. The adoption of knowledge from the MOOC was therefore a result of the careful collation of knowledge products, the dissemination process, as well as individuals’ motivations for engaging in the course. Motivation was critical for this phase, with participants noting that strong connections they had to the course content were made because of areas of personal or professional interest. As mentioned in findings related to knowledge validation, the adoption of new knowledge was enhanced through relating it to an individual’s beliefs and setting. For example, in his reflective report Amir described the knowledge that was relevant to the religious institutions in which he worked:
I am also interested to encourage those in religious institutions (especially Madrassah’s – Islamic religious schools) to learn from and adopt the practice of educational dialogue. I think this could really encourage young learners to develop into adults that are at home in society more, being who they are and want to be.
Knowledge adoption also involved considerable reflection. In her reflective report Hannah explained: “I delved into areas that I thought I knew about, but soon realised I had partial understandings about or that I had studied these ideas from a single perspective; now I was exploring them from multiple lenses.” Diane and Grace similarly described their reflections regarding the knowledge from the facilitator’s course: “We realised we were being inauthentic. We weren’t modelling professional expectations in our approach – dissonance there. Because we felt beholden to accreditation.” (Diane and Grace, interview transcript)
Collaboration with peers within the oTPD course as well as those within institutions strengthened the knowledge adoption phase as well. In her reflective report, Isra noted: “I found some of the forums beneficial in grasping the material and hearing new ideas. For instance, I am planning on trying one of the activities a participant shared.” Diane and Grace worked together from the same institution and recommended: “I think that wherever possible, involving more than one person from each institution to enable off-line as well as on-line developments” (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire). They argued that this resulted in an easier time contextualising the course materials and transferring the knowledge and principles to their setting.
Implementation
Similar to the above phases, adopting knowledge does not mean that it will automatically be implemented into teachers’ professional practices. As articulated in the OECD (2000) report on knowledge mobilisation, “adoption is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for the application of new knowledge or practice. Adoption involves a willingness to change, but a wide range of barriers may impede successful implementation” (p. 40). The findings indicate that implementing new knowledge is strengthened through practical resources that can be easily localised, having institutional support including time available for this, and opportunities to collaborate with colleagues.
The tools and resources from the course offered participants a structure in which to implement knowledge. Many participants described setting up ground rules for talk in their settings, for example. As Zahra noted in her reflective report: “I used all of the teaching repertoires in my lessons to some extent but there’s a lot more structure and purpose.” Amir similarly noted: “The course has also given me a range of tools to be able to access and experiment with. This feels really empowering” (Amir, reflective report). Sarah added: “The T-SEDA templates pack was invaluable and I adapted it to suit our environment and the limited timeframe that the staff were working within” (Sarah, case study questionnaire).
Having institutional support and creating buy-in for the approach were also important for the implementation of new knowledge. Teachers had to have time to be able to dedicate to this, and have access to support networks to create accountability and maintain momentum. Interestingly, however, a few practitioners from contexts that they described as not aligned with dialogic pedagogy have made strides to overcome this challenge. For example, Ghasem continued to share his learning with his colleagues even though he noted that there was little interest from his colleagues or institutional leadership (Ghasem, interview transcript). In his reflective report Elijah similarly explained: “I come from a region in Nigeria where our teaching is centred on the teacher rather than the students. But I have learnt to involve my students in their own learning and create a dialogic space that supports them to think creatively.”
Involving the learners in knowledge implementation appeared to also be beneficial. For example, David works in a Higher Education institution in Australia and noted:
I shared Mercer’s breakdown with my students and had them reflect on their latest group discussion and asked them to describe the quality of their talk. Most agreed that their talk group was cumulative in nature. We then discussed ways to encourage exploratory talk in their following group discussion. (David, reflective report)
Implementation appeared to also be strengthened through the use of a dialogic approach. As Lina noted in her reflective report, “I networked and interacted with colleagues from other settings and countries discussing the impact and strategies of implementation”. Isra similarly noted: “I found some of the forums beneficial in grasping the material and hearing new ideas. For instance, I am planning on trying one of the activities a participant shared” (Isra, reflective report).
Importantly, participants were able to articulate what worked well and which challenges or barriers remained for the implementation of their new knowledge. For example, David reflected: “If I think about it now, I could have done more to foreground the importance of exploratory talk at the start of the unit – especially given the unit is on critical and creative thinking in education” (David, reflective report). Zahra similarly assessed her implementation of the knowledge in her reflective report:
Individual (student pair) works really well in maths and Arabic lessons. Group (student led) needs to be developed further. I think with the regular follow up of ground rules for the talk is something I need to do more often to make grouping repertoire work better.
Institutionalisation
Institutionalisation involves knowledge becoming a “sustained, routine practice that is accepted as ‘normal’” (OECD, 2000, p. 40). This is likely the most complex phase in the knowledge mobilisation process and the most difficult to assess. However, because of the reflective nature of the course content and the final learning products submitted, participants were well equipped to describe the ways in which they had embedded the knowledge they had gained into their routine practice and how they planned to do this.
There was a clear recognition of the importance of the role of the local facilitator for this phase of the knowledge mobilisation process. Participants recognised the need to have institutional-level support in order to embed knowledge, and planned to instigate this themselves where it did not exist. For example, Ava wrote in her reflective report that she planned to: “collect experiences in order to be able to share these approaches with colleagues and possibly also facilitate their implementation on a larger scale in my institution.” Participants also noted that building confidence through the acquisition of knowledge regarding the fundamental theories behind educational dialogue was critical in bringing that knowledge to their colleagues.
Factors that appeared to influence the knowledge embedding process included providing enough structure to ensure that dialogic pedagogy was promoted but not so much structure that it does not allow for agency and creativity. This echoes Design Principle 2 in Chapter 5.1. Participants from the facilitator’s course also recommended that change never be imposed, but rather everyone has a role in the knowledge mobilisation process. Diane and Grace also mentioned the importance of managing expectations for themselves and their colleagues regarding how change manifests, as this is not a quick or simple process:
This isn’t a quick fix – sometimes in education we’ve been tempted to go for quick fixes. This is an investment – it’s a way of being. Not a quick fix and not right for every aspect of your work – have to be quite discerning. Goes back to authenticity.  Also sometimes we have to be instructional and actually didactically teaching it’s the best way. (Diane and Grace, joint case study questionnaire)
This notion was shared by Christina in her reflective report who recognised that adapting practice was an ongoing endeavour: “As the course progressed, I started thinking about how to turn teacher-led learning activities into more student-centred ones. This will be an on-going exercise.”
Further strategies shared by participants to encourage institutionalisation were engaging different support networks to promote buy-in to the approach, since buy-in is necessary to adopt new learning into practice. These included colleagues as well as parents and community members. Diane and Grace explained that their summer term meeting was “pivotal” where “tutors became co-researchers with us” (Diane and Grace, interview transcript). Ghasem noted the importance of involving parents from his secondary school setting. He argued “parents are very important for dialogic teaching because classroom dialogue should be continued at home” (Ghasem, case study questionnaire). This also resulted in parents providing his school leadership with positive feedback that he hoped would contribute to a wider interest in adopting the pedagogy. In his reflective report, Zahid similarly described his plans to:
Engage parents and other community members to support students’ learning through the community’s existing or indigenous knowledge to solve problems through dialogue. This is also a process of decolonization and promotion of indigenous knowledge.
Having the course structured to encourage deep reflection was also noted by participants as encouraging embedding knowledge from the course into their practice. Sarah explained: “I did enter more of a dialogue with myself on a weekly basis and enjoyed the diagnostic and reflective approach to my practice and role as a facilitator that was fostered by the course materials and tasks set” (Sarah, case study questionnaire). This is also touched on by David in his reflective report:
One of the most profound impacts has been on the way I think about teaching and learning in light of learning about the dialogic stance. This concept has reshaped the ethos of my classroom from one of direct, top-down instruction to one of collective inquiry and shared ownership of knowledge.
This suggests that a focus on the concepts and fundamental theories of those concepts, coupled with opportunities for reflection and dialogue encouraged participants to embed that knowledge more easily. This reflective process was also noted by participants as itself a component of the knowledge institutionalisation process that should continue. For example, David explained in his reflective report that he also has “embedded much more reflection time into my teaching to allow personal insights and indeed questions to crystalize in the minds of students in relation to the overarching question. As a result, I have noticed a sense of collegiality in the group and a willingness to talk openly about the challenges and opportunities faced in education.”
Incorporating dialogic approaches for when teachers in the institution share knowledge and access further professional development was also considered important for embedding the knowledge as well. In her reflective report, Isra (based in Turkey) described this regarding her setting:
Most professional development sessions are one-shot programs where guest speakers share their knowledge on a topic. Teachers are mostly passive listeners and do not enjoy such sessions. Incorporating techniques from dialogic teaching and creating dialogic space will help teachers learn from each other. If done regularly, I think such sessions will also motivate teachers to engage in dialogue outside of professional development sessions. It may help engender a culture of sharing and co-constructing knowledge.
The four case study respondents who had taken the facilitator’s course described knowledge institutionalisation as first requiring their own development of knowledge products. This was particularly successful in the case of Diane and Grace, who described how they were still using the tool they developed after the MOOC two and a half years later. This suggests that in order for knowledge to be embedded in practice, local facilitators must undertake their own phases of knowledge mobilisation: producing relevant products that can be easily validated by colleagues, collating the evidence they planned to share with their colleagues, disseminating this knowledge in meaningful ways for them to be adopted into their colleagues’ knowledge base, thereby enabling their colleagues to implement and embed these shifts in their own perceptions and practice. For example, Sarah utilised the reflective cycle from T-SEDA to frame her work with the teachers in her setting: 
The pack was well-received by colleagues. It provided scaffolding as needed and access to key resources that they could choose to explore if they wanted to. I was then able to meet with colleagues to discuss their projects individually, using the pack to facilitate discussions about progress, methodology and impact. Each teacher was also paired with a ‘research partner’ within the group to bounce ideas off and act as a critical friend throughout their cycle, providing a second support structure from those undergoing the same process of reflective research. All staff completed posters at the end using a template I designed based on the T-SEDA cycle that summarised their reflective cycle and these were displayed alongside departmental work on oracy/SoL at our Festival of Sharing in June 2021. (Sarah, case study questionnaire)
This suggests that the model of facilitation can also lend itself to facilitators’ colleagues engaging in their own process of knowledge mobilisation, as presented in Figure 12.
 
Figure 12: Process of knowledge mobilisation within and beyond the facilitator’s course

Challenges associated with institutionalisation included losing momentum with colleagues over time. For example, Sarah reflected:
I felt that I started the cycles off strongly, drawing staff together regularly through working lunches and in staff training slots, but as the cycles evolved time pressures in school impacted the regularity of meetings and the cycles became more independent due to the lack of time that could be devoted to a more hands-on facilitation. In many ways, the pack mitigated this by providing remote support and colleagues did utilise their research partners effectively too. The cycles were impactful in so far as they enabled staff to reflect, diagnose, action and reflect again upon their dialogic practice, but we have not repeated them due to other internal foci and the time that they demanded from colleagues with many other regulatory and academic pressures upon them. (Sarah, case study questionnaire)
To mitigate this, Ghasem noted the importance of a community of practice to lean on for support and motivation, particularly when there is no institutional interest in the pedagogy. He argued that this should be a communal online space where “teachers can talk to others about their problems and seek solutions” and importantly recommends that this community incorporate a dialogic culture: “we need a dialogic atmosphere or dialogue space between teachers in the world” (Ghasem, case study questionnaire).
6.1.6. Discussion
RQ1: How did participants reconstruct the knowledge from the MOOC in order to adapt it to their local settings?
The findings suggest that the knowledge reconstruction process was not linear and was influenced by a number of factors. This is supported by Levin (2008) who described the relationship between knowledge and use as bidirectional: “practice affects research just as research affects practice” (p. 8). While the process was multidimensional and complex and involved the unique social and cultural environment of the individual, their institution, and wider context, there were cross-cutting themes to highlight regarding this process.
Participants reconstructed knowledge from the course content and their peers through reflecting on its applicability to their settings and the alignment with their beliefs and practice. This substantiates Hood’s (2018) research in which she argued the following: 
Teachers’ prior knowledge and beliefs, including their personal interpretations of teaching and learning, their values, past experiences and their school and organisational context, all combine to influence how they assess and utilise a resource. (p. 599)
Participants also brought in alternative perspectives through course peers or their colleagues as part of this reconstruction process. This dialogic component of the knowledge reconstruction process was pivotal for participants to move from adopting the knowledge from the MOOC to implementing it in their practice, and disseminating it to their colleagues.  
RQ2: How did this knowledge reconstruction process impact participants’ perceptions and practices?
The knowledge reconstruction process deeply influenced the level of impact seen on participants’ perceptions and practices. Those participants who were able to collaboratively reconstruct knowledge appeared to have higher levels of documented impact on their practice. This was particularly the case for Diane and Grace who saw immense success from their research collaboration and tool co-design. Levin (2008) noted that “personal contact and interaction remains the most powerful vehicle for moving evidence into practice” (p. 8). This is opposed to knowledge mobilisation being focused on providing teachers with reports or other similar research products (Ibid). Having tools that provide the pedagogical principles with easily adapted practical outputs are helpful, but including methods to discuss these tools with others and incorporate their knowledge can make them much more impactful.
It is also important to note the varied barriers to knowledge mobilisation. This was most often cited by participants as their availability to undertake the process, lack of institutional support and alignment, inability to access the collaborative features of the course, and a lack of interest and buy-in amongst colleagues. Interestingly, while wider barriers from the literature include a lack of sufficient high quality evidence and unavailability of that evidence (Levin, 2008), course participants cited this collated knowledge as a strength of the course and a strength of oTPD more widely because of its potential reach and ease with which to collate and filter materials.
RQ3: Which course and design factors influenced changes in perceptions and practices?
There were commonly referenced features from the course design that appeared to influence the ways in which participants engaged in the knowledge mobilisation process. For example, the use of reflective exercises for participants to engage in consistent deep reflection, documenting positionality, offering opportunities for meaningful collaboration with peers, and promoting the model of local facilitation to encourage institutional buy-in and support. In addition, having dialogic pedagogy as the fundamental concept in which the MOOC series engaged particularly lent itself to the knowledge mobilisation process. Zahra referenced the literature in her reflective report regarding this: “According to Wegerif the dialogic space is a shared space where ideas can resonate together, merge in some ways, clash in some ways and ultimately stimulate new ideas.” Diane added: “Dialogue is a way of structuring professional knowledge” (interview transcript). 
The structure of the course also connects with teacher agency and retaining autonomy through the knowledge mobilisation process. While courses can structure activities and exercises that encourage reflection, it is recommended that this is done under the framework of teacher agency and empowerment and scaffolding is provided for support.
6.1.7. Conclusions
This case study sought to contribute towards a better understanding of how educators reconstruct knowledge from oTPD (RQ1) and how this impacts their perspectives and practices (RQ2). The findings indicate that educators go through a complex process of knowledge reconstruction that is deeply affected by their social and cultural background and setting. The findings also suggest that this process is strengthened through consistent reflection, a dialogic approach and opportunities for collaboration with peers, and institutional support. This has implications for course designers and facilitators in recognising these factors that influence the knowledge mobilisation process (RQ3), and in providing: (i) activities that encourage reflection and collaboration; (ii) practical tools and resources that are easily adapted to different contexts; and (iii) opportunities for local facilitators to take on a leadership role within their institution to promote buy-in.
While this study was able to provide an overview of the ways in which participants engaged in the knowledge mobilisation process within the MOOC, the scope of the study meant that it was unable to capture the complexity of the knowledge mobilisation process in full. Indeed, the circumstances under which our sector generates new knowledge and the uptake by teachers stands to be significantly better understood. The findings make it clear that knowledge mobilisation is not a one-way, linear process and the multidimensional and highly contextual affective factors make it challenging to generalise findings. Limitations for this case study also included the limited scope of perspectives included in the data collection and further research would benefit from more detailed experiences following oTPD participants after they have had time to reconstruct knowledge from the course.
Further research should also seek better understanding of the resources and infrastructure needed to support more effective knowledge mobilisation for teachers as it relates to oTPD. This is particularly necessary for contexts in which teachers engage with and reconstruct knowledge that does not align with their existing practice or beliefs (or that of their institutions). Lastly, more research regarding researching knowledge mobilisation is needed including the methodologies and considerations for investigating these processes.

6.2.2. Introduction
Teacher professional development (TPD) is a long-term process that occurs throughout an educator’s professional life. TPD can refer to formal pre- and in-service learning, as well as informal collaborations with colleagues, all with the aim of continually improving practice. TPD programmes typically review, assess, and build on educators’ knowledge of content and pedagogy, their skills, attitudes, and instructional approaches (Luneta, 2012). 
Online TPD (oTPD) courses have become globally ubiquitous, providing advantages for remote support to educators, particularly those seeking in-service TPD that complements their busy schedules. However, there continues to be a limited understanding of the ways in which participants engage with, experience, and learn from such courses. Further research is urgently needed to ensure that the needs of participants, their experiences, and barriers to participation are identified and mobilised to course providers. In addition, the application to practise and broader experience of participating in oTPD can vary immensely between individuals, and there is significant value in research considering the diversity and particularity of experiences of those engaging with oTPD. 
This study was conducted by an international group of educators who came together as participants and facilitators of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) entitled ‘The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue’  (henceforth referred to as the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC). This course was designed, developed, and facilitated by two members of the Cambridge Educational Dialogue Research (CEDiR) group at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge.  This paper reports on the first 6-week cohort of this free course, which took place from February to April 2022. The course was designed for teachers and teacher educators of any subject in schools and tertiary institutions globally who were interested in learning about the foundational theories behind educational dialogue. The aims of the course were to: (i) introduce educators to the key theorists, methodologies, and debates in the field of educational dialogue across all phases of education; (ii) equip participants to reflect on their own thinking about dialogic pedagogy and practices in their context; and (iii) prepare participants for further courses that support systematic reflective inquiry into their practice. It was advertised via the CEDiR network through an email invitation and social media posts. 
208 participants from 40 countries enrolled in the course and completed the pre-course survey. 47 of these participants completed the post-course survey, and 45 participants submitted a reflective report as their final learning artefact and were issued with a Certificate of Completion for the course. Figure 13 offers selected demographics of course participants. 
 
Figure 13: Participant demographics
This study is predominantly a phenomenological exploration of the lived experiences of participants conducted within a conceptual framework of self-study and reflective practice. It draws on original data from the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC, which is built on through additional detailed reflections of a subgroup of participants. The analysis considers central features for participants in selecting and engaging with an oTPD course, and the resulting impact on their practice. The study concludes with a comparison of existing predictions of oTPD with participants’ perceptions, posing implications for course designers and facilitators alongside a direction for future research. 
6.2.3. Review of the literature
Online teacher professional development
There has been a growing interest among policymakers in providing remote and alternative support to educators (Quota et al., 2022). This, in combination with the necessary move to online learning globally during the Covid-19 pandemic, has led to an explosive growth of oTPD programmes (Hartshorne et al., 2020). oTPD can offer flexibility to learners who are able to dictate the speed at which they work, allowing them to take greater control (Major et al., 2018), and can also (potentially) reach educators in remote locations and accommodate their full schedules (Lay et al., 2020). When used appropriately, technology can be leveraged to enhance access, participation, engagement, and the continued application of new skills in the classroom (Quota et al., 2022). However, there is also much room for improvement and further research is needed, particularly as it relates to the perspectives of participants in low-resource contexts. 
The significant growth of oTPD programmes has resulted in a challenging scenario where programmes are outpacing the research and are being developed and launched without a sufficient evidence base to draw on. In this absence, general principles and guidelines relevant for in-person TPD are frequently assumed as applicable to online courses and programmes without considering whether specific research-based practices actually transfer well to online environments (Lay et al., 2020) and to international online environments which have participation from multiple cultures. The global nature of an online international MOOC further highlights the importance of contextual factors that shape what a participant draws from oTPD. Course design and research, therefore, needs to take into account the role of cultural differences (Rienties et al., 2023), external (i.e. governmental or institutional) mandates or expectations regarding professional development, as well as an educator’s own beliefs and values about education (Beach et al., 2021). Acknowledgement also needs to be given to the reality that what participants gain from oTPD may not always align with the stated outcomes of the providers (Yurkofsky et al., 2019).
Dialogic and community-based approaches to oTPD
Approaches to TPD have evolved over the last half century, offering a shift from a ‘deficit approach’ (i.e. a focus on content knowledge and use of external expertise to deliver it) to a ‘technical approach’ (i.e. a focus on teaching practice that is school-based with outside help) towards the idea of continuous professional development (Sawyer 2001; Day & Sachs 2004). This has resulted in an increasingly collaborative and situated perspective (Derri et al., 2015), focusing on the individual teacher’s responsibility to direct his or her own professional development process.  Teacher reflection and agency within TPD can be especially effective as it focuses on specific learning needs identified by educators and leverages ongoing professional learning communities (Bransford et al., 2000). 
Educational dialogue allows learners to co-create new knowledge in a subject area and to understand that differences between perspectives – in the classroom as well as in global society – can be a source of new insights and meanings (Bakhtin 1981; Shor & Freire 1987; Wegerif et al. 2017). The ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC both focused on educational dialogue as the subject area of the course and was also framed by a dialogic approach that aimed to provide a structured environment for learners to build on one another’s ideas through posing questions, providing reasoning and justification, and critically evaluating their own and others’ contributions (Alexander 2008). Major et al. (2018) argue that digital technology can enhance the use of dialogue for learning and can result in increased communication between learners. The same argument can be applied to oTPD. Furthermore, online courses can provide greater opportunities to see alternative perspectives through internet-mediated intercultural dialogue with potentially a wider range of teaching contexts. Mercer et al., (2019) caution that “technology must be used with a dialogic intention, in the context of activities which are well designed to promote collective thinking” (p. 197). This is echoed in most of the literature consulted, which asserts that it is the pedagogy that is paramount, not the technology. 
In addition to a dialogic approach, the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC sought to leverage the value of a community of practice in providing a supportive environment for educators (e.g. Lieberman & Miller, 2008; Ryoo et al., 2015). Communities of practice are formed when individuals (in any sector, not just education) engage in a process of collective learning (Wenger-Trayner & Wenger-Trayner, 2015). In education, this could involve teachers sharing their practical experiences and creating opportunities to learn from one another (Sentance, 2016). Communities of practice can also cross geographical and cultural boundaries, allowing wider networks to develop and providing ways for individuals to connect who are geographically isolated. However, these opportunities do not arise spontaneously and online spaces must encourage, facilitate, and maintain participation. 
There is a limited understanding of the ways in which participants engage with oTPD programmes, and more rigorous research is needed regarding how technology may afford new forms of interaction and dialogue among educators pursuing oTPD. The optimal conditions for oTPD, and the impact on student achievement are still largely unknown (Lay et al. 2020). Research is especially important which considers potential barriers to equitable access and other ways in which participation can be limited. Liyanagunawardena et al. (2013) argue that “In reality [online learning] may well be serving only the ‘privileged’ in developing countries who already have ‘access to digital technologies and international language learning” (p. 5). The level of learning that takes place within online learning is also often critiqued in the literature, with particular concern around the low completion rates of MOOCs. In most MOOCs, including the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC, a significant number of participants are not visibly active and there is a gap in the literature around understanding the ways in which these participants experience such courses. 
This research study is guided by three research questions to address these gaps, drawing on examples from the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC: 
1.	How do educational practitioners perceive and experience the contexts of online learning in reference to their professional development? 
2.	What are the most significant perceived influences on participation, engagement, dialogue and retention in online teacher professional development? 
3.	How can future online courses leverage the insights shared by study participants, in order to improve the overall experience for educators pursuing online professional development? 
6.2.4. Methodology
Phenomenology and self-study
This study uses phenomenology, which is a philosophy and approach to research that seeks common meaning within participants’ lived experiences (Creswell 2013). Husserl (1907) proposed that to understand the world, one should examine the lens through which they experience it as opposed to attempting to examine the world itself. This is considered an appropriate method for this study as it aims to uncover the essences of the lived experiences of educators pursuing oTPD, and seeks an understanding of how participants make sense of the course structure, content and its application to their everyday world (Creswell 2013; Eddles-Hirsch 2015). 
This study is additionally conducted within the framework of reflective practitioner self-inquiry. This refers to educators studying themselves in action within their educational contexts to improve their professional practice, advance their professional understanding and contribute to public debates about improving teacher education for the common good (Pinnegar & Hamilton 2009; Loughran 2004; Samaras & Freese 2009). The authors are directly involved in the course under investigation as either course facilitators or participants, providing a direct understanding of the MOOC experience. Furthermore, the authors participated together dialogically as practitioner-researchers from separate contexts (Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, India, and Switzerland), exchanging situated understandings and perspectives about teaching and learning, and relating these to wider settings. 
Research design
Data used for this study were collected and analysed in two phases, as depicted in Figure 14.
 
Figure 14: Data collection phases
In the first phase of data collection, four selected questions from the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC pre- and post-course surveys (responded to by 208 and 47 participants respectively) were systematically reviewed using constant comparison methods. These questions explored participants’ prior experiences with oTPD, their motivations for taking the course, and their feedback regarding its strengths and weaknesses. Findings informed the design of the second data collection phase and an initial analytical framework. 
Data collection during phase 2 included two 90-minute focus group discussions (FGDs) with a total of 5 participants, and a detailed reflective questionnaire with 8 participants (see Appendix J). Study participants were purposively selected from a working paper group that was formed by participants of the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC following its completion. They had participated in the course (either in part or to completion), were willing to describe their experience in a FGD or detailed questionnaire, and had already undergone the process of articulating their positionality and values in association with the research area and were thus already engaged in a process of self-study and reflection. The group had in-depth knowledge of the objective phenomenon and the ability to reflect on their subjective experience. Additionally, the participants represent diverse geographies, contexts and working environments, enabling the research questions to be interrogated for themes integral to participants’ experiences of oTPD. 
Drawing on Moustakas’ (1994) and Giorgi’s (1985) qualitative adaptation of Husserl’s (1907) transcendental phenomenological approach, questions for the second stage of data collection were concerned with the participants’ detailed perceptions of and experiences in the specific environment of oTPD, using the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC as the central example. The questions devised for this study were framed by the results of the first stage of data collection and analysis but were also intentionally open-ended in order to give participants the opportunity to voice their own thoughts and opinions. FGD data were transcribed from recordings, and coded alongside questionnaire data by three of the authors, in an iterative process of analysis using a qualitative phenomenological approach, as illustrated in Figure 15. 
 
Figure 15: Phenomenology phases
This structured approach maximised rigour through referring emerging themes back to the original protocols, explicitly noting and reporting discrepancies in the data, and integrating the results into exhaustive descriptions of the phenomenon under investigation. Participants’ descriptions were captured in full. 
This research was carried out in accordance with the British Educational Research Association’s ethical guidelines (BERA, 2018). Informed consent from each participant, in both the wider course and in the smaller subset of participants, was obtained prior to the data being collected. Participants were provided with detailed explanations of how much of their time would be required and how their data would be used. All data were anonymised and stored securely. Institutional approval was provided by the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge for this research. 
This study recognises the potential dilemma of bias (Mercer, 2007) given that the researchers share roles as MOOC designers, MOOC participants and practitioners invested in developing dialogic pedagogy. This study could therefore be predisposed towards educational dialogue as well as overrepresenting the positive aspects of findings associated with the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC. In order to mitigate for biases, the research began with responses to a questionnaire about the researchers’ positionality and values (see Appendix O), which allowed the research team to explore prejudices and presumptions in relation to the phenomenon being studied. However, we also embrace our positionality, as it brings us a unique opportunity for deeper analysis and reflection enabling us to think about ideas we might not have considered alone (Dusdal & Powell, 2021), afforded by the internet (Wegerif, 2013), to critically challenge, justify and build on reflections through dialogic interthinking (Littleton & Mercer, 2013), and to analyse data as an international community. Through this approach and the overarching research design, this research has the potential to build on current evidence and provide practical guidance for oTPD programmes to leverage.
6.2.5. Findings
Findings are presented thematically and discussed within the study’s overarching research questions. Textural descriptions (i.e. narrations of participants’ perceptions of a phenomenon) have been woven throughout the themes to provide further insight into the real, lived experiences of participants, using their own words. 
Educators’ perceptions of oTPD
Participants described oTPD, particularly MOOCs, as an opportunity to have more agency and autonomy in the direction of their professional learning. Participant F summarised this as follows: “I think it’s a way in which I can take control over my own professional development interests and needs. It gives me agency to choose, rather than being told to participate in allocated in-house CPD sessions at work”. Participant H adds that oTPD “means carving out a space for me to grow… when I attend something that I have chosen I am more motivated and feel a greater worth of effort, in terms of possible transfer.” This sense of agency extended into their activity and participation within the course itself. Participant D described how being able to step back from an online setting as and when it felt right compares to in-person participation because of the anonymity of a massive online setting: “Rather than the course telling me what I must do, I have the ownership over what I do and what I take forward. That’s unique and gives me more autonomy”. 
The transcendence of time and physical space was described as an additional core feature of oTPD. This refers to the ability of participants to complete the course activities according to their schedules and availability, with both asynchronous and synchronous elements. Participant E reflected on this: 
If I had to tell a colleague what it is like to attend an online learning course, I would say that it is a very different training process from others in which there is usually a teacher guiding, more or less strongly regulating the work and teaching and learning time. Physical and temporal barriers also disappear and therefore one can be anywhere and at any time taking a class, watching a video, reading about class material and thus attending a certain part or activities of the course. 
The flexibility offered by many oTPD courses means that participants are also able to experiment with the subject matter in their settings in between course sessions. Participant E described the assignments from the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC as offering the space and time “to rehearse, to travel an unknown path, and the appropriate frameworks to analyse, reflect and change specific practices. When added together, they make a very interesting snowball effect.” 
This connects with the perception shared by participants on the importance of reflection within oTPD:
I don’t see online courses as courses per se but as well-developed prompts – they are valuable resources for thinking and professional reflection. That reflective function is useful because unlike an accredited or required course, online courses like the ‘Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue’ allow you space to play with the ideas. (Participant D) 
Furthermore, leveraging this type of learning opportunity was considered to be critical for working in the current landscape of technological ubiquity. Participants described how the very nature of their workplaces is changing, particularly following Covid-19, and there was a reported trend of using online platforms to connect with colleagues and other sector peers. This extends beyond gaining subject-related knowledge, and provides an opportunity to exercise and develop their digital (online technical and social) skills to be able to access further resources online to ultimately strengthen their practice. Related to this, participants also viewed oTPD as a tool to access easily navigable and curated quality materials from renowned institutions that have the capacity to provide educators with up-to-date research through continuously adding recent studies, materials and tools: “The clarity of the content and how it was curated is helpful for teachers who have significant competing priorities and are perhaps unable to read a large volume of research articles” (Participant B). The iterative nature of technology-enhanced learning lends itself to this perception as does the tendency of MOOC materials to remain online indefinitely, acting as a resource hub of sorts.
Lastly, participants consistently referenced oTPD, and MOOCs specifically, as offering an opportunity to engage with diverse perspectives. When asked about the advantages of oTPD, Participant A responded: “Diversity and people coming from different places. In [my country], there is not much of a chance to meet others and discuss concepts in-person.” Participants felt that this was more possible than in face-to-face TPD because of the openness of the courses and the ability to connect with a wide range of educational practitioners from varied contexts: “The chance to access different cultures and theoretical backgrounds in these courses could expand our knowledge… In comparison to face-to-face courses or other traditional courses” (Participant E). 
Educators’ experiences with oTPD
oTPD courses, including the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC, were selected by participants for varied reasons and found through different search mechanisms. Some searched for specific courses online and others followed word-of-mouth sources, as was the case for Participant D: 
Unless I’m required to complete them, I don’t usually go searching for online professional learning opportunities. Of course, if there are some interesting courses recommended on my social networks, then I look into them. This was exactly how I came to participate in the [‘Fundamentals’] MOOC. 
Once participants found a course of interest, they would evaluate its applicability to their aims and setting, paying particular attention to the subject of focus, the length and structure of the course (including whether and how interaction will take place with course peers), the potential practical impact of the course materials, and accreditation. Accreditation was agreed by those participants who mentioned it as being lower on their list of requirements, if the other elements of the course were present. Participant C remarked that accreditation has "less value in this context in relation to the quality of the course and ability to interact meaningfully with others” (Participant C). However, they also noted that it does serve as reassurance that the course is credible and is willing to formally recognise their effort and contributions.
The ways that participants engaged with the structure and content of oTPD courses differed between individuals and differed for those individuals between courses. This was discussed as a key component of oTPD; i.e. the flexibility of being able to engage with the course activities and materials to the extent of one’s capacity and interest. This extended into how participants defined meaningful engagement for themselves, and whether that included contributing to others’ learning. It typically did with the participants in this study, but they recognised that it was not the case for others in the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC or even for themselves in other courses. As articulated by Participant E: “I wonder when I start a course, will I be more active? Will I be a listener and take notes and that’s it?” Participant E went on to describe their participation despite not contributing to the interactive elements as much as others in the course: “I tend to be more of a listener than a talker. I write more than I speak for instance. It doesn’t mean that I’m not involved in learning.” This serves as an interesting area of how participants derive benefits from participating in specific, sometimes isolated, features of oTPD. As articulated by Participant D, “I think it can be isolating, but in some ways a balance between contact and isolation is good – there are opportunities to think and reflect personally and opportunities to connect, network and share”. 
Course impact on participants’ personal and professional lives manifested in varied ways. The discussion of this focused on learner intention and their intended takeaway(s) from the course. If, for example, a learner intends to engage in oTPD to build their network, the resulting impact will likely look different from a learner who comes in with the intention to learn more about a specific theory. Regardless, there was agreement that outcomes of participation in oTPD were multidimensional. For the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC, participants described a combination of intended and unintended outcomes, which are summarised in Figure 16. 

 
Figure 16: Intended and unintended outcomes, as articulated by participants
Influences on participation, engagement and retention
Five areas emerged as particularly significant influences on participant engagement and retention in oTPD. First, participants agreed that if the intention of the learner (motivation for taking the course and aims for their participation) matched with the course intentions, there would be a likelier scenario of engagement and retention. This relates to the need for participants to have intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for participation, otherwise they will be unlikely to fully engage in (and complete) the course. 
Second, the cost of a course can be prohibitive to practitioners, and often means the difference between enrolment or not. Participants who had funding from their institutions still noted cost as a factor since the application process to prove the alignment of the course with institutional priorities could be tedious. Participants also noted the critical importance of an oTPD course having a very clearly defined and rationalised structure and set of expectations for the learner. This includes clarity around the course’s conceptual framework and use of the pedagogy it seeks to impart: “One aspect that would make me drop out of a course would be the development of traditional activities or work assignments that are not in line with the fundamentals and objectives of the course itself” (Participant E). This will help learners to know whether the course is relevant to their working context and needs, and aligns with their individual aims. 
Third, participants’ capacity for engagement included availability, access to the appropriate infrastructure and connectivity in order to participate to the extent required, and digital literacy. These areas deeply affected participants’ capacity to engage with the materials and maintain their participation. Participants described their digital skills as being honed through other oTPD opportunities and the need to adapt to online environments. They agreed that the acquisition of digital skills was both a prerequisite for meaningful participation in the course and an outcome of meaningful participation. 
Fourth, participants explained that the course environment has to be conducive to their learning in order to remain engaged. This includes the platform itself being easy to use and navigate without complex technological features, and having support available to participants who require it. Participants noted that courses should be structured logically, with a balance of enough information and resources without being overwhelming. This also includes having an atmosphere that is warm, inviting and inclusive in order for participants to feel comfortable expressing and sharing their (emerging) thoughts, reflections and opinions. As articulated by Participant E, “I think we need to feel safety and that we’re in a place that we feel like we can express ourselves”. This discussion included how the atmosphere of the course had to encourage deep reflection in order to impact and develop educators’ practice. Participants recognised the role of the course facilitator in creating this atmosphere, and how this can enable the formation of a community of practice that continues following the completion of a course’s cohort. 
Fifth, participants consistently returned to the theme of connecting with other practitioners, and were driven to engage by having access to a diversity of perspectives in their own learning. Participants defined meaningful interaction as the inclusion of a variety of ways and opportunities to easily connect with others in the course, share practice and co-construct new knowledge. A number of associated statements have been included in Figure 17 to illustrate this point.
 
Figure 17: Participant statements regarding dialogue amongst peers
Challenges with engaging in the forum and other interactive features of the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC included internet connectivity, time zone conflicts with live events, differing understandings of what peer dialogue means between participants, and language. In a way that speaks to the needs of diverse contexts, language was noted by two participants who cited it as a challenge for engaging in an English medium oTPD. One participant noted the discomfort associated with this, remarking that “sometimes I feel uncomfortable if I cannot think I can interpret everything that is said, since intonation and forms of speech vary between people and countries” (Participant E). While Participant B shared similar misgivings about nuances of language being lost in communication, they also noted the utility of using a digital platform. In their view, “one of the most crucial aspects of [the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC] was that my online interactions necessitated technology. Being a non-native English speaker, I relied on English translation tools.” 
6.2.6. Discussion
Findings suggest learner intention to be a key driving force of motivation that sustained participation in the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC. There was a critical intent on the part of the learner to seek specific oTPD that resonated with their own desired outcomes. When learner intent and expectations (e.g. to engage with and learn from other practitioners) were met through the course design and environment, this impacted positively on participants’ experiences and engagement. This points to an amalgamation of positive experiences in a loop of interactions with oTPD, which build on previous learning experiences, intentions and expectations. 
Outcomes from engaging in oTPD include a range of skills (pedagogical, digital, social online) in addition to subject knowledge. Changes in participants’ own thinking, levels of knowledge and confidence, as well as skills development and opportunities for reflection individually and together, all contribute to their self-development. This self-development then contributed to greater engagement in online discussions. 
Participants’ experiences of creating intercultural dialogue between themselves, as educators, were largely positive. They recognised the affordances of technology for facilitating dialogue through the strategic use of interactive features. All participants welcomed others’ perspectives in their own learning process, and expressed interest and motivation to know and understand how other educators interpret and enact educational dialogue. Many agreed that they would likely not enrol in an online course that did not offer the ability to meaningfully connect with other practitioners. This commitment to connect with and learn from diverse perspectives and settings in a collective learning experience contributes to the formation of a community of practice in educational dialogue. Indeed, the connections formed within the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC began the working group that co-authored this research paper. 
In light of the emerging phenomena, this research points to a number of implications for oTPD course designers and facilitators to improve learners’ experiences.  First, the aims of the course should be clearly identified and articulated so that participants can better understand whether and how these align to their own values and intentions for their participation. Such an approach sets participants on a trajectory of increased confidence and capacity for oTPD, as well as increased levels of engagement within and positive perceptions of oTPD programmes more widely. 
The findings also indicate that course designers should frame oTPD with the recognition that learners shape their own and others’ experiences. There is a clear desire for educators to guide their own professional development as opposed to their institutions deciding this for them. For providers of oTPD, this also means critically considering key stakeholders, where priorities in design and intent are targeted less at educational institutions, and instead are designed with the recognition of learner priorities, their students and contexts. This in turn can encourage participants’ capacity building not ending with the acquisition of subject knowledge alone. Drawing on the notable components of the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC to enable this, elements (like dialogue) should be included as a tool to shift both the individual and collective consciousness, and recognise the greater depth of learning that can come through taking charge of one’s development. Moreover, the desire to be part of a community draws attention to the notion of identity. If, as Buchanan (2015) suggests, agency is “identities in motion” (p. 714), then providers of oTPD need to be attuned to the role that they play in forming and sustaining teacher professional identities. 
Lastly, community-building should be integrated in the oTPD course structure alongside aims for collaboration beyond the course which may grow into a community of practice, which is deftly summarised by Participant C: “I think good courses should continue to maintain online community hubs for present and future participants in mind, to sustain learning beyond the virtual classroom and course programme duration”. The use of educational dialogue as a pedagogical approach lends itself to this aim, through the intentional use of activities to encourage multicultural dialogue. 
6.2.7. Study limitations
A number of limitations are present within this study, many of which relate to issues regarding equitable access to oTPD. This research acknowledges the undoubted absence of many participants, as it equally acknowledges that the participants who came to the study did so with access to technology, and equipped with the skills needed to participate in the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC. Furthermore, all but one of the study participants in the second stage of the data collection and analysis completed the MOOC. This helped participants to understand the barriers to participation such as technological capability and learner self-motivation, however this also provides a collective perspective that largely does not include the voices of individuals who were unable to participate. 
It must also be noted that participants in this course were a unique blend of educational professionals, who were motivated to engage with learning about educational dialogue through oTPD. They wanted to learn from peers in different contexts, all with a view to developing their own professional practice. This is therefore a unique set of participants, who are a highly educated and motivated group in their own right, engaging with a more philosophical and theoretical MOOC than the vast majority of oTPD courses. This specificity of both the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC and its cohort may render findings from this study less generalisable than a standard oTPD course, with a cohort of educators all from the same school or city for example. For such a course, the intended outcomes and objectives of the course providers and the expected and actual outcomes for participants may well be disparate and varied. This paper contributes learning towards the application of insights gained here, to other similar and varying contexts, and also encourages further research in the arena of online or in-person TPD courses. 
6.2.8. Conclusions
This study sought detailed descriptions of educational practitioners’ perceptions and experiences of oTPD, drawing on examples from the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC. Research findings indicate that oTPD participants are intentional, reflective, and critical learners who shape their own and others’ learning and experiences. Educators perceived oTPD as: (i) an opportunity to enact agency and autonomy in their professional development; (ii) a flexible environment with time and space to be able to connect the learning with their context; (iii) providing resources for deeper thinking and reflection; (iv) an opportunity for developing 21st century skills, as they relate to TPD; and (v) a platform for engaging with diverse perspectives. 
While levels of engagement differed significantly between participants and between courses for individual participants, the findings illustrate how participants are responsive to course design (i.e. course aims, subject, structure, cost, time required, and opportunities to meaningfully connect with other practitioners). These areas significantly influenced the participation, engagement and retention in the course, as well as the ultimate impact of the course on their personal and professional lives. 
Technology is set to continue to play a large role in professional learning and there is great scope to use oTPD strategically, alongside in-person TPD, to enhance access to effective learning and encourage educator agency in setting the direction for their professional development. However, these programmes should carefully consider the identified challenges and barriers; for example, balancing asynchronous and synchronous components to account for time zone conflicts, accounting for unreliable internet connectivity through offering low-bandwidth features or downloadable options of course materials, clarifying expectations of levels of engagement required, and recognising language constraints for learners to name a few. oTPD courses would also do well to utilise a framework that recognises learners as agentive practitioners who guide their own development. This can encourage capacity building as not ending with the acquisition of subject knowledge alone and can result in a greater depth of learning, particularly when educational dialogue is used as a pedagogical tool to co-create new knowledge between diverse participants. Findings from the ‘Fundamentals’ MOOC indicate that a dialogic approach can increase collective learning and participation. This intentional sharing of diverse perspectives and reflective engagement with the differences therein can ultimately contribute to fostering a community of practice. 
This study has sought to address current gaps in the literature through the documentation of detailed perceptions and experiences of oTPD participants. This research seeks to inform oTPD programmes through a better understanding of the ways in which participants engage with, experience and learn from such courses. Further research should engage with a more significant sample of detailed descriptions of experience from participants undertaking oTPD. It is urged that this includes voices from those with less technological privilege. In addition, it was not possible in this study to consider the outcomes of participants’ learning in their varied contexts and environments, especially in terms of assessing the impact on quality of learning for their students, and how they experience their own reflexive practice. Notwithstanding the limitations of the scope of this study, this research seeks to contribute to a growing body of work towards understanding the optimal conditions for oTPD and its ultimate impact on educators and learners. 
6.3. Case study 3: Equitable access to MOOCs for teacher professional development
6.3.1. Overview
This case study was developed in order to explore reach and equitable access to oTPD in further detail through analysing the perspectives and experiences of a selection of practitioners from the MOOC trials. This case study has not been published, however a version was submitted and accepted for presentation at a symposium at SIG 20-26 EARLI conference in September 2024 in Berlin. It is presented in a similar way to the previous findings and discussion sections to retain consistency in style.
6.3.2. Background
TPD is needed to develop and enhance educational dialogue in practice, and the use of online learning tools and courses such as MOOCs have the potential to scale support to more educators globally. Through oTPD, educators can access learning opportunities that are not available in their local contexts, and can connect with a wide range of practitioners in other settings (Dede et al., 2009). Possible affordances of oTPD include access to quality content in areas without in-person alternatives; flexibility of the course schedule to work around competing commitments; opportunities to collaborate and reflect with other practitioners globally; and in the case of MOOCs, this also includes a no- or low-cost model. In low-resource contexts, online learning also has the potential to increase the reach and access to quality TPD. 
However, significant challenges remain in accessing these courses, which are often faced most by already marginalised populations. Barriers include the digital literacy required, difficulties in the translation and localisation of materials, and the level of learning that actually occurs (Liyanagunawardena et al., 2013; Major et al., 2018). MOOCs in particular have suffered from low retention rates and inflexible course content which cannot be easily contextualised by all participants. Importantly, these courses also cannot be completed or engaged with by individuals who lack consistent and reliable access to devices, internet connectivity and electricity.
Online education therefore risks widening existing inequalities (Dawadi et al., 2024; Gyamerah, 2020). For example, in the context of Nepal, Devkota (2022) indicates that inequalities in Nepalese higher education are reinforced through online education because of a lack of language, technical, and pedagogical support for marginalised learners. Inequalities in digital access and inclusion exist within and between countries, and significant barriers have been reported in enabling access to digital technologies (e.g. see Burns and Gottschalk, 2019). In MOOCs, this can result in particularly high attrition rates for already marginalised learners (Dziuban et al., 2018).
Having equitable access and digital inclusion at the forefront of an oTPD course’s design and facilitation is critical to mitigate these continued challenges. Access refers to which students are actually able to enrol in a course and equity ensures that the needs of all learners are met and that, "there is a concern with fairness such that the education of all learners is seen as being of equal importance." (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2017, p. 7). Research on inclusive education has traditionally focused on students with special educational needs and disabilities, however the sector has begun to take a wider look at inclusion (Mezzanotte, 2022), which is the position that this case study takes. Broadly speaking, inclusion is “a process that helps to overcome barriers limiting the presence, participation, and achievement of learners” (Ibid, p. 7). Related to this, equitable access and digital inclusion strives for full participation by all participants regardless of background, and recognises the numerous resources necessary for this level of participation. Digital inclusion involves “leveraging digital tools to widen access and enhance the quality of teaching and learning for the purpose of delivering a fair and equitable education” (European Commission et al., 2021).
With the increasing popularity of oTPD opportunities, it is critical to consider who is able to access and meaningfully engage in online TPD, who is not, and the ways that equitable access and inclusion can be promoted through course features.
6.3.3. Aims
This case study explores the equity of enrolment and participation in the Educational Dialogue MOOC series. There is a clear need for further evidence and documentation of experiences regarding enablers and barriers to equitable access of online learning for educators, and their ability to engage in the course with cohort peers. This case study therefore asks three questions that have guided the research:
RQ1: What affordances can MOOCs provide to teachers globally in accessing an online forum of educators
RQ2: What are the barriers to teacher participation?
RQ3: What course and design features promote equity and inclusion in accessing online teacher professional development?
It is the objective of this case study to contribute towards a better understanding of how to form relevant, effective, and genuinely dialogic online spaces for practitioners to come together in a community of practice that is accessible to all educators. 
6.3.4. Methods
This case study builds on findings from the wider study. These courses were created to be relevant for a wide range of in-service school-level and higher education educators in varied geographies. Following initial analysis of questionnaire responses (279 pre-course and 64 post-course) and the formation of associated design principles, case study methodology (Hamilton, 2011) was utilised to explore the above research questions. In-depth questionnaires and interviews were conducted with five purposefully-selected participants from Iran (n=1) and Sierra Leone (n=4) who had participated in one or more of the course trials and were willing to share their experiences. The participant from Iran took the course independently, and the group of participants from Sierra Leone all worked in the same institution. Table 13 provides an overview of the data sources.
Table 13: Data sources for Case Study 3

Phase 2: Case study data	Case study questionnaires and KIIs	n=5

Responses to ten questions from the pre- and post-course questionnaires from the three course trials were analysed with the case study research questions as a guideline. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse responses to closed-ended questions, and inductive thematic analysis using constant comparison methods was used to analyse responses to open-ended questions. The results of the survey analysis regarding reach and access influenced the design of further case study data collection. Survey results are presented in Chapters 5.1 and 5.2 and so are not repeated in this section to reduce repetition. 
In addition to utilising this wider data regarding the demographics of participants and accessibility affordances and constraints (as reported in Brugha and Hennessy 2022 and Brugha and Ahmed 2023), in-depth case study interviews and questionnaires (see Appendix K) were conducted with five participants. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were conducted with each of the five participants, which included two individual interviews (approximately 30 minutes each held on Google Meet), a group interview with three of the four practitioners from the Sierra Leone group (approximately 45 minutes held on Google Meet), and responses to five questionnaires (via word document attached to emails because of challenges associated with internet connectivity and filling out an online questionnaire). The interviews were conducted first and sought to elicit initial insights and reflections on issues regarding access and equity in the participation and completion of a MOOC for teacher professional development. These were followed by detailed questionnaires, which allowed the respondent more time to provide details regarding their contexts, their history with online learning and educational dialogue, how they define access to oTPD, affordances of oTPD for their settings, as well as barriers to access, participation and collaboration with course peers. This questionnaire also sought respondents’ recommendations to make oTPD more accessible and inclusive. Interview transcripts were transcribed and transferred to NVivo for coding. Top-down coding was conducted first and was based on Warschauer’s (2003) conceptual framework of resources that shape digital inclusion:
1.	Physical resources, which include access to appropriate hardware, reliable access to the internet, electricity and a physical space to study.
2.	Human resources, which include digital literacy, prior education and experience with the content, and self-regulated learning skills (Means et al., 2014).
3.	Social resources, which include facilitators, peers and colleagues.
This coding was cross-cutting for the three RQs. Other relevant information in the data was also considered to better understand specific affordances of MOOCs (RQ1), barriers to teacher participation (RQ2), and course features that support inclusion (RQ3). Emerging or open codes included affective aspects (for example, pastoral support, flexibility in course design, scaffolding in resource provision, etc.). New findings that emerged from the analysis of the case study data were documented and compared with existing findings from previous analysis from the wider study, documenting confirmation and counter-examples throughout.
6.3.5. Findings
Using Warschauer’s (2003) conceptual framework of resources that shape digital inclusion, findings are presented and discussed by resource category, drawing on the experiences and insights shared by course participants. Note that demographics of participants are presented above in Chapters 5.1, 5.2, and 6.2 and are therefore not repeated here.
Physical resources
According to Warschauer (2003), to effectively engage in online learning, participants need access to appropriate hardware, reliable access to the internet, electricity, and a physical space for study. Availability of infrastructure emerged as critical during the case study interviews, particularly with the Sierra Leone team. This included connectivity and bandwidth infrastructure as well as reliable and consistent access to devices. This was described by participants as a significant barrier in accessing oTPD, including for this MOOC series:
“In some parts of the world, like rural areas especially in my setting, there may be challenges with poor internet connectivity and unstable electricity, making it difficult to have consistent online engagement.” (Kabiru, Sierra Leone)
“My ability to fully interact with the course contents and take part in live activities was hampered by technical problems, such as sluggish internet connections.” (Foday, Sierra Leone)
Human resources
In addition to challenges associated with accessing devices and connecting to course sites, participation in the MOOCs required a level of digital literacy to navigate online learning platforms efficiently and participate in the various features. As articulated by Kabiru (Sierra Leone): “Some teachers may face challenges in adapting to online learning platforms if they lack the necessary technological skills or familiarity with using these tools.”
To mitigate this, the course design included the site navigation being intentionally simplified, and the development of a comprehensive user guide for participants to access to make troubleshooting technical issues easier. However, soft skills were also required to participate in the collaborative components of the course. Kabiru (Sierra Leone) explained: 
One challenge is the difficulty some teachers may face in familiarising themselves with the technology and using the functions of the platforms like Zoom to join breakout rooms. Additionally, if the breakout room structure is not well-defined, it may hinder active participation. For example, if the agenda does not provide everyone with an opportunity to contribute to the conversation, some teachers who are not accustomed to online discussions may find it challenging to engage effectively.
Kabiru offers a design recommendation here, which is to provide structure that explicitly enables inclusive participation and recognises the potential fears associated with participating in synchronous as well as asynchronous online dialogue for some participants.
The varied levels of familiarity with educational dialogue also necessitated a ladder of support for participants to access. Case study participants all had an underlying investment in educational dialogue and a clear initial interest in expanding their knowledge on the subject. This gave them the confidence to engage in the interactive features of the course, but they noted that additional support should be available for participants who do not have familiarity with the content. This included access to a wide range of resources that can be relevant for varied settings as well as tools that can be easily contextualised. As noted by Kai (Sierra Leone), this use of a resource bank “enables teachers to explore diverse topics and gain new insights into teaching practices.” Participants also agreed that having downloadable tools that could be easily adapted to different settings were critical. This could help mitigate the challenge identified by Miriam (Sierra Leone): “The challenge was that the MOOC format necessarily is quite general so if one is in a slightly obscure context like ours, then it is harder to see how the learning might be contextualised.”
Self-motivation and time management skills deeply affected participants’ abilities to sustain their engagement in the materials and complete the course, as identified by participants in the questionnaires and interviews. As Foday (Sierra Leone) reflected: “I found it challenging to set aside enough time to finish readings, watch videos, or actively participate in discussion forums or live events because of the demands of my job, my personal obligations, or my conflicting schedules.” The level of flexibility within the course structure appeared to both resolve this challenge whilst simultaneously exacerbating it. Participants agreed that flexibility within the course design was needed in order to allow for participants’ competing priorities and scheduling conflicts, however this needed to be balanced with accountability mechanisms to ensure that momentum was maintained. Kai (Sierra Leone) summarised this as follows: “Online professional learning allows teachers to engage in learning at their own pace and at a time that is convenient for them, making it accessible for busy teachers… [however,] some educators may struggle with staying motivated and organised in a self-paced environment.”
Social resources
Social resources that were necessary for participants to access and engage in the course materials included myself as the course facilitator, cohort peers, and institutional support including that of participants’ colleagues. Accessing these social resources within the MOOC was consistently cited as the most influential factor motivating participants to take and engage in oTPD, and to sustain the impact from oTPD. This went ahead of accreditation, accessing content they could implement, and fulfilling professional development obligations. Similarly, when asked about other examples of highly effective and impactful professional learning opportunities (online or otherwise), respondents provided examples of TPD that were focused on collaborative learning.
There was significant interest from all participants who submitted pre- and post-course questionnaires in participating in a community of practice in which experiences related to dialogic practice and specific tools can be shared. On an international level, this included “peers from different locations [who] share ideas and engage in discussions to enhance their professional growth” (Kai, Sierra Leone). 
Kabiru (Sierra Leone) specifically noted the use of the discussion forum for this:
When considering online courses, certain components are important to me. One vital component is a discussion forum. It allows participants to engage in dialogue, share experiences, and ask questions. This collaborative space provides valuable insights and perspectives from fellow educators, enriching the learning experience. It also allows for clarifying concepts and seeking further explanations… engagement and access to course instructors are also important.
This desire for collaboration also extended beyond the course and into local settings. When asked what it was that attracted him to the MOOC, Foday (Sierra Leone) responded: “First, it was accessible. More importantly, I saw the MOOC as a useful learning opportunity for me which I hoped to share with my teachers and people in my department.”
However, the level of access to peers as social resources differed between participants and some were unable to fully participate in the discussions taking place, for example because of language barriers or inexperience with the course content. Further challenges collaborating with cohort peers are summarised by Foday (Sierra Leone): 
Time zone differences and technology difficulties are what I believe are obstacles to conversing with others in a global online course. It takes approaches like allowing for multiple time zones, allowing participants to go at their own pace, and offering technical assistance to get over these obstacles.
Foday (Sierra Leone) offers recommendations for how these barriers can be addressed: 
Relevance, a supportive online community, a secure and polite atmosphere, clear guidelines, scheduling, flexibility, facilitator assistance, and technological competence are some characteristics that affect a teacher’s participation in online teacher-to-teacher interaction.
Kai (Sierra Leone) added that being recognised in the dialogue (e.g. through responses or likes) can also help address some of the barriers: “Recognition is key. Teachers will participate in any dialogue if they are recognised. If you are not recognised in any dialogue, we will be bored and not be paying attention.”
Respondents also recognised the challenges of an exclusively online course: “It can be challenging to build relationships and engage in spontaneous discussions” (Kai, Sierra Leone). His colleague, Foday (Sierra Leone) added: “the absence of the instant personal interaction present in face-to-face settings, which hinders participation and makes it difficult to forge genuine connections with teachers and peers, was another difficulty for me.” Ghasem (Iran) agreed: “in face-to-face we can create more effective connections… the biggest challenge I faced while taking these courses was connecting with other learners”. Ghasem went on to explain his experience: “in the MOOC, the relationship between learners was not strong but our facilitator had made a strong connection”. Having this connection with a course facilitator was impactful for his journey throughout the course trials.
Having opportunities to engage in dialogue and exchange thoughts and tools with other practitioners was considered to be both a requirement and outcome of access. Participants noted that despite encountering challenges in participating in online dialogue via the forum and live events due to language barriers and lack of confidence, they were also driven by contributing to and being part of a global community of practice: “We should work on relationships with the members of MOOC as a community with a dialogue culture. We need a dialogic space between teachers in the world. We should have a plan for follow-up” (Ghasem, Iran).
Another component of social resources for digital inclusion are local colleagues and institutions. Most participants from the wider course data noted the importance of support from their settings and the alignment of the course with their institutional priorities, such as the Sierra Leone team who all agreed that dialogic pedagogy was aligned with their institutional and current government foci. However, Ghasem (Iran) articulated educational dialogue as being in opposition to his setting, which he described as using traditional practices. He sought the course to connect with other like-minded practitioners.
6.3.6. Discussion
These findings offer a range of implications for course designers and facilitators, which are discussed within five themes and address RQ3. Each theme can be leveraged to improve equitable access and digital inclusion in similar oTPD environments in consideration of the three resource categories from Warschauer’s (2003) conceptual framework. It is clear that technology is not culturally neutral, and there is a risk of continued marginalisation and inequity through users blindly importing ‘western’ paradigms into international contexts. And while it is likely impossible to remove cultural influences from a course’s design, these five areas can be leveraged to mitigate those factors.
First, the inclusion of representative participant voices involves collaboration with course participants from the course conception through its design, launch, facilitation and evaluation. It is clear that understanding learners’ contexts through involving their voices in the design of the course is critical. This views the learner as an expert in their field and setting, and recognises their critical role in driving change. As articulated by Gunawardena (2020),
It is crucial that local actors who understand the sociocultural context identify the needs for which they want the project, design the process of change they envision, and manage and evaluate it… Local actors must own the project if it is to become sustainable. (p. 7)
This results in a more relevant programme and content because it has involved educators in decision-making. It also ensures that the learning (and materials) can be localised, as the unique needs of the participants and their settings have already been captured.
Related to participatory approaches, the second theme argues that being community-led and driven through opportunities for meaningful collaboration and learning partnerships creates a more accessible avenue to shaping the course.
Third, reflective and adaptive course materials and tools should be available that guide participants in metacognitive exercises and content. The literature supports this; for example, Escobari et al. (2019) indicate that marginalised learners who have experienced disempowerment and who internalise a narrative of self-doubt benefit from interventions that focus on changing the way they think and reflecting on their thinking in addition to content-related interventions. Reflexive activities should not be reserved for only the learner but rather, the facilitator should also engage in a continuous process of reflection and inquiry and confront bias in a direct way. As recommended by Gunawardena (2020), courses would do well to design for cultural inclusivity, not neutrality. To do this, it is critical for course designers and facilitators to reflect continuously on their own cultural biases. Positionality was a central consideration for the wider research study throughout all research phases (see Section 3.5 for an overview of the process and documented reflections). This was coupled with reflective exercises incorporated into the course structure to encourage participants to undertake a similar process of self-reflection.
Fourth, flexibility in program structure can help marginalised learners succeed. Escobari et al. (2019) indicate that adult learners are especially likely to face time, financial and familial constraints when returning to formal study. The MOOC series benefitted from offering flexibility where it mattered most to participants, whilst also acknowledging the importance of maintaining momentum through the inclusion of strategic accountability devices.
Fifth, providing scaffolding to participants through a ladder of support for both digital literacy as well as content-related support. While most MOOCs do not list prerequisite knowledge or experience, there appears to be a discrepancy between the level of the content in the course and students’ capabilities. Related to this, resources should also be examined for inequities as well that are perpetuated through the language of the course, citations, resources, etc. As articulated by Knupfer (1997), “inequities that result from the practice of instructional design often go unrecognised because they emerge not just as a result of what has been done, but also as a result of what has been left undone”.
6.3.7. Conclusions
This case study explored: (a) the affordances that MOOCs can provide to teachers globally in accessing an online forum of educators; (b) the barriers to participation; and (c) which course and design features promote equity and inclusion in accessing online teacher professional development.
Findings revealed equity issues across all three resource areas including reliable access to devices and internet connectivity, varied levels of digital literacy and prior experience with both online learning as well as the concepts associated with educational dialogue, and lastly with accessing the course’s community and collaborative activities and events. Warschauer’s (2003) conceptual framework was leveraged to discuss ways to address these concerns and increase equitable access to online learning through course design and facilitation strategies. These strategies include: (i) positioning participant voices as central in course design; (ii) providing avenues for participants to meaningfully collaborate with their peers (both on the course and locally via a local facilitator or learning communities); (iii) incorporating reflective activities for both participants and facilitators; (iv) ensuring a flexible course structure; and (v) providing scaffolding for digital literacy and course content.
While accessibility was positioned as central in designing the MOOC series, access remained a significant challenge for many participants. The course objective was not to reach the most marginalised communities of learners, but rather to trial a prototype that could convene an online community of practice; the conflict being that in so doing, it inadvertently likely excluded the most marginalised learners. Even those participants who had prior experience with online professional development and with educational dialogue but experienced one or more accessibility constraints in the above themes did not complete the course.
There is a clear case for oTPD to be used to strategically enhance access to effective professional learning. Participants shared positive experiences alongside challenges, which are aligned with wider sector evidence. Continued research is needed that features the real, lived experiences of participants in global oTPD from marginalised communities. Furthermore, inclusivity and accessibility in oTPD stands to be better defined as it relates to these contexts. There continues to be a lack of understanding of the depth of inclusivity, which results in a simplistic definition and therefore an inability to adequately address its weaknesses. These were also limitations in the wider course series, which additionally could not track individual experiences. More data is needed, particularly as it relates to classroom-level impact as well as institutional and community-level support. A more in-depth case study that draws on multiple contexts would be helpful and may increase the generalisability of associated findings.
