# Refining the design principles

The second publication is an extension of the initial design principles, whereby the design principles were tested and refined accordingly. This publication was published in Routledge Open Research in the Digital Pedagogy Collection and was co-authored with Dr Farah Ahmed, with myself leading the research analysis and writing, and with continued support from Farah regarding the conceptual framework, writing, and revisions.

## Introduction
Online Teacher Professional Development (oTPD) opportunities have become increasingly prevalent, particularly since the Covid-19 pandemic (Hartshorne et al., 2020). While these online courses may offer continued support for the formation and sustainability of teacher communities of practice in a post-pandemic world, further research is required to develop and assess good practice. Specifically, design considerations are needed by the sector that promote teacher agency and empowerment through the delivery of theoretically informed oTPD that enables metacognitive change. This refers to the ways in which teachers can change the way that they think through engaging in oTPD.

In this study, we offer an analysis of a theoretically informed Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on educational dialogue to inform a deeper understanding of the delivery of a prevalent form of TPD via online platforms. We explore the format and structure of delivery and how this was shaped by the conceptual framework of the course, which draws on related research highlighting the need for teacher agency and the flexibility for teachers to be able to apply their learning to varied contexts (Hennessy et al., 2021). This research explores and reconsiders the ways in which we learn, teach and commune as professionals and learners. It also explicitly builds on previous research conducted by Brugha and Hennessy (2022), which offers ten design principles for scalable and sustainable online professional learning programmes that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment. These design principles were developed based on the evidence from trials of other MOOCs that are part of the same series as the course analysed for the present study. The wider framing of this research is supporting teachers to enact high quality educational dialogue in their classrooms in order to improve learning outcomes and a range of 21st century skills.
## Research context

### Educational dialogue

The work on educational dialogue has been generated by the unequal nature of classroom talk in which teachers and not learners are often the primary speakers in the classroom. Furthermore, when learners do speak it is typically not dialogically. In dialogue, participants actively and respectfully listen to each other, they contribute by sharing their ideas, justifying their contributions and engaging with others’ views. They explore and evaluate different perspectives and reasons, and knowledge is built collectively within a lesson – or over a series of interconnected lessons – through linking questions and contributions between speakers (Alexander, 2008; Wegerif et al., 1999). Educational dialogue means prioritising classroom relationships and recognising that education is an exchange between people (Alexander, 2008). In this exchange, learners have as much, if not more, of a role to play than educators. Taking a dialogic stance (Boyd & Markarian, 2011) can transform classroom and school cultures and can support learners by valuing forms of knowledge that learners bring with them (Flecha, 2015; Freire, 2000). Such knowledge is welcomed and taken seriously in a dialogic setting.

Research evidence on educational dialogue indicates that it is an effective pedagogy to enhance learning outcomes. It has been linked to improved content knowledge, text comprehension, and reasoning (Clarke et al., 2016; Alexander et al., 2017; Howe et al., 2019); and can increase critical reasoning skills (Mercer, 2008; Wegerif et al., 1999). A team at the University of Cambridge produced evidence about specific dialogic moves in teacher-student dialogue that are strongly associated with learning gains (Howe et al., 2019). They found the dialogic moves: building on ideas, invitations to build on ideas, and challenging and questioning others’ views, particularly powerful. Learning gains were only evident when these dialogic moves were made in the context of a supportive classroom, however, in which students actively participate and respectfully engage with others’ ideas.

### Online teacher professional development and MOOCs

TPD programmes can be an effective avenue to support educators to develop their dialogic approaches. Increasingly, online models of delivery are being used for professional learning programmes, with potential benefits including wider and more inclusive access, as well as opportunities for international professional dialogue through shared reflection, which can lead to further collaboration (Dille & Røkenes, 2021). MOOCs in particular offer open access, including a no- or low-cost model and a wide, global reach. However, the quality and impact of professional learning in such programmes and online environments stands to be better understood. MOOCs, for example, have typically also been shown to have low retention rates (figures of 10% and lower retention rates are widely cited in the literature) and inflexible course content which cannot be easily contextualised for all participants; and they are only really accessible to those individuals with access to internet connectivity, devices and digital literacy to meaningfully participate in the course (Haßler et al., 2018; Major et al., 2018). In low-income countries they may be disproportionately used by the most privileged learners (Liyanagunawardena et al., 2013).

In their systematic review, Badali et al. (2022) identified motivational factors that influence retention and completion rates of MOOCs, which included academic, social, course, personal, professional and technological motives. This is noteworthy because it is clear that motivations go beyond academic pursuits, and there are other important motivators at play. This review also indicates the importance of enabling learner autonomy, competence and relatedness. The literature needs more evidence regarding defining engagement in MOOCs, however, and further understanding regarding how MOOC features contribute to a learner’s experience and impact changes in their perspectives and practice. As Hew et al. (2020) suggest, completion rates in MOOCs are not the only indication of MOOC success. Interpreting findings, whether that be from one course as a case study or a wider analysis of course statistics, should be done cautiously.

A mechanical MOOC offers an experimental alternative to the traditional MOOC format, and seeks to address some of the more common criticisms of MOOCs, as described above. A mechanical MOOC offers a bespoke platform for each course, which is built using open-source software on a limited budget through using existing technologies already known to users. The course platform is conceptualised and developed as a community learning hub, where learners are encouraged to collaborate and draw on their own and one another’s experiences and knowledge to acquire further knowledge. The mechanical MOOC model rejects instructionalism, i.e., an instructor ‘providing’ the education and instead embraces constructionism, which argues that the most effective learning activities are ones that result in the development of a meaningful product or artefact (Papert, 1980). This allows for a participant to take a course more than once and be able to continue to derive meaningful learning from it. Mechanical MOOCs also encourage the development of local learning communities within the course in order to localise and contextualise the course resources, offer opportunities for collaboration between course peers, and enhance accountability for course completion. For example, they seek to provide opportunities for project work based on the unique needs of the learners’ contexts in collaboration with peers through offering avenues to be matched with others taking the course who are in the same geographical location. For example, in MIT’s Media Lab’s Learning Creative Learning course, their model intentionally promotes building an ongoing learning community and includes grouping students to share ideas and provide feedback.  This course also promotes utilising ‘champions’ who are particularly engaged participants from previous cohorts to take on more leadership roles within the groups in order to build a culture of community-driven learning. The mechanical MOOC structure is the model used by all courses in the Educational Dialogue MOOC series that this study features.

### Educational dialogue MOOC series

In order to strengthen educational dialogue practices internationally, a MOOC series was iteratively designed and developed for educators in schools and tertiary institutions. The series is based around some of the intersecting main research areas of the CEDiR (Cambridge Educational Dialogue Research) group, a research group within the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge that draws together a range of Faculty colleagues who are interested in dialogic pedagogy and aim to create and share high quality research. The Educational Dialogue MOOC Series was developed as a means of data collection for two separate research studies:

1. PhD research study: ‘Dialogic Online Teacher Professional Development: The Use of Technology to Build a Community of Practice in Educational Dialogue’, authored by Meaghan Brugha, which explores the intersection of technology and educational dialogue to enhance teacher professional development.
2. Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship: ‘Trialling Dialogic Halaqah in Islamic education settings’, undertaken by Farah Ahmed, which evaluates if halaqah in Islamic schools and settings can support young Muslims in developing their shakhsiyah Islamiyah.

This paper presents an analysis of Course 1 from the Educational Dialogue MOOC Series, entitled ‘The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue’ (hereafter referred to as the Fundamentals MOOC). The Fundamentals MOOC was developed for practitioners interested in learning about the foundational theories behind educational dialogue, and was designed based on feedback from participants from other course trials in the series. The full suite of courses within the series is presented in Table 7. It was recommended to participants that they complete these courses in order. There are a total of six MOOCs in the series, which include three core MOOCs as well as three additional MOOCs for those working in Islamic settings. These six courses are currently operating at different stages of progress, as indicated below.

![alt](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/img/table7.png)
 
Each core course offers six weeks of materials, requiring approximately 2 to 3 hours from participants per week on course readings, activities and discussions. Each course can be taken as a ‘live course’ with a cohort of teachers or as a self-paced course at any time of the participant’s choosing. These courses are for all educators working with any age group including adults, working in any setting, full-time or supplementary schooling, who are interested in learning to use dialogic approaches to enhance their teaching and improve learning in their settings.

These courses, particularly Courses 2 and 3, draw on the materials and learning of the Toolkit for Systematic Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) collective. T-SEDA is a toolkit that provides practical guidance and customisable templates for practitioners to systematically analyse the use of dialogue in their settings, reflecting on their own and their peers’ practices. All three MOOCs also draw on T-SEDA’s approach of practitioner-centred and practitioner-led inquiry-based learning. Educator feedback from initial trials indicated that effective inquiry-based learning in educational dialogue required a deeper engagement with the theories that underpin it. This feedback led to the development of the Fundamentals MOOC and presenting a full suite of courses for participants to work through as opposed to standalone courses. Although the course content in this MOOC is not inquiry-based as such, the course was constructed to support educators to engage in a reflective cycle which could be described as a ‘theoretical inquiry’, that is, iterative weekly reflection on how theoretical ideas could inform their classroom practice.

The Fundamentals MOOC was designed with three objectives:
1. Introduce learners to the key theorists, methodologies and debates in the field of educational dialogue across all phases of education.
2. Equip learners to reflect on their own thinking about dialogic pedagogy and practices in their context.
3. Prepare learners for further courses that support systematic reflective inquiry into their practice (i.e. Courses 2 and 3 in the series).

Each of the six weeks followed different theorists and themes and included activities to help practitioners reflect on these theories regarding their own practice. This approach aimed to support educators to engage more deeply with educational theory than they typically do in TPD, and in a more sustained way over a six-week period. The following is a screenshot of the top of the Week 1 page of the course.
 
![alt](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/img/course1screenshot.png)

The following is a summary of the thematic foci for each of the six weeks: 

**Week 1: An introduction to educational dialogue**
Week 1 focuses on understanding the distinction between educational dialogue and classroom talk as well as the relationship of dialogue to thinking and learning. We provide an overview of terminology and outline the development of dialogic educational theories and practices. 

**Week 2: Robin Alexander - Taking a dialogic stance**
Week 2 looks at the ways in which attending to classroom ethos can support educators and learners to take a dialogic stance.

**Week 3: Neil Mercer - Interthinking through exploratory talk**
Week 3 builds on taking a ‘dialogic stance’, by exploring the mechanisms of how thinking happens and is developed through dialogue. We look at Neil Mercer’s use of the term ‘interthinking’ to explain how dialogue enables knowledge and understanding to be co-constructed, in particular through learners working in groups.

**Week 4: Sara Hennessy - Visualising classroom dialogue through dialogic moves**
Week 4 presents research that enables educators to ‘see’ and evaluate the quality of classroom dialogue through dialogic moves. These are descriptors that qualify what kind of statement has been made, used by educational researchers to understand what types of dialogic practices and moves support children’s learning.

**Week 5: Rupert Wegerif - Opening up a dialogic space for reflection and agency**
Week 5 expands our understanding of dialogic education by looking at the concepts of dialogic space and dialogic self. We ask, how might these dialogic ideas affect how we think about our classroom spaces, and the learners in our classrooms? Why might it be useful and important to ‘widen’ and ‘deepen’ dialogue in our classrooms?

**Week 6: Paulo Freire and Ramón Flecha - Transformative, holistic and decolonial approaches to dialogue**
Week 6, the final week, looks at Paulo’s Freire’s conceptualisation of dialogic pedagogy which precedes much of the work looked at so far, and in many ways arises from a very different starting point. We then look at how Freire’s ideas have been picked up by Ramón Flecha and operationalised in schools worldwide. We build on one of the core questions from last week: Is dialogue a ‘western’ idea?

These theorists did not provide tutorial instructions and nor did we as the facilitators within the focal videos for the week, but rather these tutorials were used as tools for participants to think reflexively in order to apply the theories to their own settings.

### Design principles
In their study, Brugha and Hennessy (2022) offer ten design principles for scalable and sustainable online professional learning programmes that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment. These design principles address ten key themes that emerged from an analysis of trials of Courses 2 and 3 in the Educational Dialogue MOOC series. These themes included the ways in which participants engaged in the structure, materials and conceptual framework of the course. The design principles offer guidance and procedures for course design, but they also recommend careful adaptation in order to apply them to different contexts and courses (Bakker, 2018; van den Akker, 1999). They are summarised below:

- Design Principle 1: Integrate accountability mechanisms in the design of the course
- Design Principle 2: Provide a balance of flexibility and structure in the design of learning pathways and materials
- Design Principle 3: Offer opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration amongst participants
- Design Principle 4: Incorporate reflective activities for both local facilitators and their colleagues
- Design Principle 5: Offer opportunities for participants to create and share artefacts
- Design Principle 6: Consider the role of the participant in shaping the learning environment
- Design Principle 7: Position accessibility centrally in the design of the course
- Design Principle 8: Align the course model and platform with the pedagogy of focus (i.e. the pedagogy the course seeks to impart)
- Design Principle 9: Be intentional regarding the future of the course and consider whether and how scaffolding should be reduced for future iterations
- Design Principle 10: Build systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course into its structure

## Methods

### Research questions

The purpose of this study is to explore how technology and online learning can be leveraged to provide theoretically informed professional learning opportunities for educators that enables positive changes in perspectives and practice. To achieve this purpose, we seek to answer two central research questions:

_RQ1. Which features of the MOOC supported learning?
RQ2. What impacts on perspectives and practice resulted from participating in the MOOC?_

We discuss the findings from these two research questions in terms of how they can inform and improve Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) MOOC design principles.

### Data collection and analysis

This paper draws on selected data from the first trial of the Fundamentals MOOC, which was offered between February and April 2022. Evidence and findings are derived from two questionnaires (Appendix F) submitted by course participants prior to (212 submissions) and following (52 submissions) the live trial of the course. These questionnaires included a self-audit of practice to measure self-assessed impact of the course materials on educators’ practice before and following their participation in the course. This self-audit was developed and trialled by Gröschner et al. (2021). Further survey items were trialled during Courses 2 and 3 in this MOOC series.

Questionnaire responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and triangulated with other available data sources: discussion forum contributions (390 posts from 51 participants), learning artefacts (45 reflective reports), and reflective logs kept by the course facilitators. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with four selected course participants using purposive sampling, to explore their participation and engagement in the course, how the course impacted their perspectives and practice, and recommendations for course improvement in further detail. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically using constant comparison methods.

The research constitutes a design-based process which allows for systematic course improvement through reflective practice and different iterations of the course (Bakker, 2018). It was one part of a wider design-based research agenda which included multiple iterations and sources of data from other courses in the MOOC series and cycles of designing, trialling and refining activities according to the evidence. Participatory design is utilised in each course in the MOOC series through actively seeking participant feedback at all stages of the course development, trial and post-cohort analysis. Indeed, this study builds on the previous work of Brugha and Hennessy (2022) in which prior MOOC trials for Courses 2 and 3 in the same series were analysed. This iterative trialling generated ten proposed design principles for online teacher professional development courses. The present research used these design principles to frame the data collection and analytical approach, both to address the research questions, but also as a testing ground for the principles themselves.

### Course participants

794 individuals registered for the Fundamentals MOOC and were included on the weekly email listserv regarding course information and updates. This was significantly higher than the two main trials for Course 2/3 in the MOOC series, which had 39 and 28 registered participants respectively. Out of these 794 individuals, 212 completed the pre-course survey and self-assessment of their practice and 52 completed the post-course survey, 42 of whom repeated their self-assessment. 45 participants submitted a reflective report as their final learning artefact and were issued with certificates of completion for the course.

Educators participated in the data collection voluntarily and provided their written, informed consent via the pre-course questionnaires to have their anonymised data and survey responses used for the PhD and Post-Doctoral research studies. Further information regarding both studies was provided via the consent form as well as the ‘About the course’ page  on the MOOC website, which included the researcher contact details for further queries. Institutional ethical approval was provided by the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge for this research.

## Findings and discussion

Research findings are presented within five core themes, which emerged from the triangulation of available data. These themes directly address the two research questions regarding the features of the online course that supported learning (Themes 1, 2, and 3) and impact on perspectives and practice (Themes 4 and 5). Each emergent theme is also discussed in relation to the ten design principles from Brugha and Hennessy (2022). This section closes with recommended modifications to the design principles, based on the findings.

**_RQ 1: Which features of the MOOC supported learning?_**

### Theme 1: Collaboration
Mechanical MOOCs attempt to eliminate barriers to access course materials by allowing anyone access at any time with no sign-up required. For the Fundamentals MOOC, any practitioner could view course videos, download resources and other related materials, and observe the discussions on the forum . Because of this open access, strategic accountability mechanisms were critical to ensure that participants collaborated with others in the live cohort and maintained momentum in completing the weekly activities. Findings from the Fundamentals MOOC pre and post surveys echo the requirements of Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 1, which recommends leveraging learning communities to address issues related to retention, as well as establishing a relationship with participants, and offering a mixture of self-paced and live options for participants to collaborate and interact. The accountability features in the Fundamentals MOOC included weekly updates and emails from the course facilitators, weekly assignments to complete (but not submit), and collaborative opportunities like the discussion forum, live events and research buddy system, which encouraged participants to complete the weekly readings and activities in order to be able to join discussions with others in the course.

Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 3 focuses on this interaction between course participants and recommends courses offer ample opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration amongst participants. This is not only an important component of the conceptual framework of the course (see Theme 3) but also for the motivation, retention and learning experience of participants. Evidence from this course trial supports this claim with pre and post surveys and interviews indicating the importance of collaboration for engagement and retention in the course. The Fundamentals MOOC is a semi-asynchronous course, which offered a live cohort; however participants did not need to attend live lectures or complete their weekly activities at the same time. This type of structure can offer challenges in providing opportunities for effective participant dialogue and collaboration. As such, collaborative activities were strategically built into the course structure in three ways: (i) a discussion forum, hosted on edudialogue.org, in which participants were asked to contribute to weekly as part of the course requirements; (ii) optional weekly live virtual events held on Zoom, where the group discussed the themes of the week and broke into small group discussions to address questions posed by the facilitator; (iii) the research buddy system,  which was optional for participants to sign up for, and involved matching them with another course participant to discuss the course materials in more depth at times of their own choosing.

According to the post-course survey, out of the 62% of participants who used the forum, 90% agreed that it was helpful to their learning and 2% disagreed (8% neither agreed nor disagreed). When asked to explain their response further, one participant notes: “The forum was helpful as a way to make contact with participants, and to learn about educational dialogue in contexts I might not have had the chance to otherwise. For me, it was a written form of educational dialogue.” Another participant said the forum held them accountable to the workload: “I made sure that I kept up with the materials so that I could post in the forums each week. This helped me to structure my time and helped with motivation.” Recommendations to improve the forum included better functionality within channels and topics to ensure that discussions were easy to follow and contribute to. Further collaboration, beyond the weekly live events, included the research buddy system, which involved matching students with others in the course in order to discuss the materials in further depth and share reflections regarding the applicability of the materials to their settings. One participant noted: “Having a research buddy helped me a lot in keeping up the pace and having a vivid experience in the learners' community.” This experience appeared to be representative across all those who engaged in the research buddy exchange.

When participants were asked whether they felt that they were able to contribute to others’ learning in the course, 61% agreed and 14% disagreed (25% neither agreed nor disagreed). Out of the individuals who agreed, 72% of them received certificates of completion while 50% of those who disagreed received certificates of completion. This builds on participant feedback, which indicates that building and participating in a shared sense of community aided in the learning experience and outcomes of the course and retention and completion rates. Interestingly, however, when asked for recommendations to improve the course, most participants requested more opportunities for collaboration alongside more structured motivation and incentives or requirements to engage in the forum or in their research buddy partnerships. This is actionable learning for both course providers and course participants; course providers should include accountability mechanisms and opportunities for collaboration as an explicit part of the course design and delivery (i.e. build on Design Principles 1 and 3 to understand their relationship), and course participants should use and leverage each collaborative opportunity to enhance their experience and learning in the course.

### Theme 2: Accessibility

Accessibility in this theme refers to the same constraints in participating and engaging in an online TPD course as presented in Brugha and Hennessy (2022): (i) participants with disabilities, (ii) digital literacy, (iii) familiarity with the concepts related to educational dialogue and educational theory, as this was a predominantly theory-based course, and (iv) available internet connectivity and devices in order to access course pages, videos, and the discussion forum. As recommended by Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 7, accessibility was positioned centrally during the course design process and individual accessibility needs were requested during the registration phase with adaptations made accordingly. This included the length and level of intensity of the course, available support for navigating the online platform, timing of and support during live events, and the ad hoc provision of structured resources and templates. The Fundamentals MOOC itself was designed to fill a gap for educators to learn the fundamental theories of educational dialogue before engaging in practitioner inquiry models in further courses in the series. Its objective was that participation in this course would make participation in the two further courses in the series more accessible through attention to promoting agency and enabling changes in perspectives and practice.

Demographic variables for the pre-course survey respondents to these questions (n=208) as well as those who filled out the pre-course survey and also completed the course requirements and received certificates of completion (n=28) are provided in the table below. This indicates commonalities of participants accessing the course as well as those who were willing and able to submit reflective reports. Numbers of participants are provided beside percentages to better understand the demographic variables.

![alt](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/img/table10.png)
 
A few variations emerge from this data. No participant 25 years or younger completed the course although 12% (n=25) of participants who completed the pre-course survey were 25 years or younger. Instead, a large increase of participants aged 36-45 years completed the course (50% compared to 35% of participants who completed the pre-course survey). Additionally, the ages of learners that the educators taught appeared to affect course completion rates, which may signify that the materials were more appropriate for those teaching higher education (i.e. 18 years and older) versus Early Childhood Education (i.e. 0-4 years). Also noteworthy is that while most participants did not have prior experience with MOOCs, 10% more participants who did have prior experience with MOOCs completed the course than originally registered. This signifies that previous experience with MOOCs may have helped learners develop the digital skills and comfort in an online learning environment necessary to engage in and complete the course.

While the Fundamentals MOOC was designed with accessibility as a guiding principle, access continued to emerge as a barrier to course completion, as was cited by 29% of participants. This was because of language barriers, access to the internet and/or devices, and time zone conflicts with the live events. The demographic data presented in Table 10 additionally signifies that barriers included the digital skills of participants and their familiarity with online learning environments, as well as the appropriateness of the content for those not teaching in higher education. However, accessibility was not the most cited barrier to course completion. Rather, ‘Too many other professional and/or personal responsibilities and commitments’ was the most cited barrier, which is discussed below. This suggests that the course structure, materials and scaffolding of support helped mitigate this common challenge.

### Theme 3: Reflection and inquiry

The full MOOC series was designed with the conceptual framework of inquiry-based learning in which practitioner agency and empowerment is front and centre to the course design. This builds on Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 8, which recommends that the course model and platform is aligned with the pedagogy of focus (i.e. the pedagogy that the course seeks to impart). In the case of this MOOC series, this is an inquiry-based and dialogic learning opportunity for a global community of learners. The success of this approach was evidenced through two key areas emerging from the data, which are discussed below in turn, and which participants reported as key components for oTPD courses: (i) providing opportunities for meaningful reflection, and (ii) enabling participant ownership and agency.

Creating opportunities for independent and joint participant reflection was a core component of the course design, and a feature of balancing course accountability with flexibility. This is recommended through Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 4: incorporate reflective activities in order to position teacher agency and empowerment centrally in the course design and delivery. This course drew on the learning from the first two trials of Courses 2/3 and the successes of practitioner-led inquiry. While the two other courses in the series have a more explicit observation or intervention inquiry model that is led by the participants in their own classrooms, this course employed the model through having participants lead their own reflective accounts each week and submit a final learning artefact at the end of the course that was based on their own exploration of the themes and materials and how those related to their settings and practice.  For example, how they adapted their practice based on the key concepts they took away from the course like taking a dialogic stance, interthinking or decolonising education. This allowed them to reflect on their own practice in detail, while simultaneously contributing to the learning of others in the course and considering how the theories might relate to different settings. The live events, discussion forum channels, and the research buddy exchange were all spaces that explicitly encouraged participants to jointly reflect on the course readings and materials and share the reflective accounts they wrote. This is aligned with Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 5: offer opportunities for participants to create and share artefacts. All courses within the MOOC series supported participants to create a learning artefact that could be built on by other practitioners.

The inquiry-based and dialogic approach of the course was also realised through significant participant ownership in the delivery of the course. This is articulated in Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 6, which recommends enabling effective avenues for participants to shape the learning environment. This level of collaboration with participants took place from the outset of the course, particularly since the course design was based on participant feedback from the first two trials of Courses 2 and 3 in the series. The course structure was continuously adapted throughout the live cohort based on the responses to the pre-course survey and the feedback elicited by email and within the live events. Participant ownership has also extended past the end of the course through all participants being invited to join a post-cohort working paper group to collaborate on research from the course findings. This group has published one manuscript (Brugha et al., forthcoming) is currently producing two additional separate papers.

Despite these avenues for participant ownership, however, when participants were asked whether they had suggestions to strengthen future iterations of the course on the post-course survey, four explicitly indicated the need to strengthen the amount of ownership participants could take on throughout the course. This included more leadership opportunities during the live events, for example, which was also feedback received from all participants in the first two events. This request is very promising as it enables Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 9, which considers how and when to scale back course facilitator support. It also points to the potential of leveraging learning communities, which can help displace the traditional training structure of an expert running a course, and instead reduce the scaffolding and support required through dispersing ownership within a community of learners. Longitudinal impact may only take place if opportunities for continued joint reflection between practitioners as well as between researchers and practitioners are available and are led in a main way by the practitioners themselves. The follow-up courses (i.e. Courses 2, 3 and the additional Islamic courses) offer a continued exploration of practice and were designed to build on the theoretical reflections from Course 1.

### Theme 4: Flexibility

Designing for flexibility, whilst also considering the accountability mechanisms, means offering a manageable timeline and workload, while simultaneously encouraging participants not to lose momentum. It also means providing participants with customisable resources and options throughout the course, a ladder of support to access as required, and adequate space for experimentation. This is articulated in Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 2: provide a balance of flexibility and structure in the design of learning pathways and materials. One participant made the following observation regarding the importance of flexibility when asked what the most valuable aspects of the course were: “Flexibility in carrying out the course throughout the 6 weeks where participants were allowed to cover the weekly materials at their pace. Frequent updates and notifications were also among the valuable aspects of the course.” Another participant noted that the “online and asynchronous options were extremely important given [my] current workload.” These sentiments were shared by other participants in the post course survey as well as in interviews.

Nevertheless, the most commonly cited barrier to participation in the course was ‘Too many other personal and/or professional responsibilities and commitments’, cited by 67% of participants. Due to the open nature of the course, any participant was able to look at the materials and not commit to the full 6 weeks of the trial. Individuals who were unable to complete the course were told that the materials would remain online for them to access in the future. This likely had an impact on the retention of participants, since they were able to access the materials outside of the cohort and many admitted to delaying their participation to a time that was more conducive to their professional and personal availability. They may not have done so if the course materials were going to be removed. A key associated learning for educators participating in online learning is to take advantage of online cohorts where possible, or convene a group of colleagues to take the course together when accessing it ‘offline’. This contributes to accountability and raises the chances of completing the course, joint reflection (see Theme 3), and provides a critical opportunity for additional support in the access areas outlined above.

**_RQ 2: What impacts on perspectives and practice resulted from participating in the MOOC?_**

### Theme 5: Shifts in perspective and practice

Participants were asked to complete a self-audit of their dialogic practices using the Dialogic Teaching Questionnaire developed by Gröschner et al. (2021) in both the pre-course and post-course questionnaires to monitor growth and regression in the use of educational dialogue in their teaching. The self-audit questions can be seen at the beginning of both surveys in Appendix F. Out of the 42 participants who filled out both the pre-course and post-course self-audit, 45% improved in their scores, 12% stayed the same, and interestingly 43% were shown to have regressed in their self-audit scores, sometimes significantly. Previous studies have also found that as participants gain a deeper understanding of dialogic practice through the course, they realise that their existing / developing practice is further away from dialogic ideals than they had previously thought. Although many forms of classroom talk can be useful for learning (Mortimer & Scott, 2003), the focus of this course is dialogic talk. Our findings demonstrate that deeper engagement with educational dialogue theories leads to a shift in participants' expectations of what classroom dialogue should be. The five participants who regressed the most all completed the course requirements and received certificates of completion. One mentioned that they had been using a dialogic approach for the last two years but “the reflections in forums and readings have given me more ideas and tools for creating dialogic space in my class.” Most of these participants also agreed that they were able to contribute to others’ learning in the course. In contrast, only two of the five learners who rated themselves with the top progression scores received certificates of completion and did not complete much of the course materials. This may similarly be because they had less access to reflective materials to accurately reflect on the theory as it related to their practice.

Because of the difficulty in measuring learning outcomes through the self-audit, the post-course questionnaire also requested information from participants regarding any changes in their professional perspectives and practice due to their participation in the course. Participants were asked to what extent their participation in the course had impacted (or was expected to impact) their practice. 63% of participants selected ‘A lot’, 29% selected ‘A moderate amount’, and 8% selected ‘A limited amount’. This scale is broad, however, and up for interpretation by the participants which made triangulation with the following open-ended question important. Participants were then asked to describe how their understanding of educational dialogue changed through the course. There were 47 responses to this question, with all participants noting positive shifts in their understanding through the course structure and materials. Out of these responses, 49% of participants provided detailed references of the materials that impacted their understanding the most, indicating genuine engagement. In particular, participants noted the importance of formalising intuitive knowledge they previously had. As one participant recalls:
Going into the course I had a narrow perception of the differences of different types of talks and their effects and the areas that they are used in. We were using them in the classrooms but we couldn't identify them. Throughout the MOOC, we have modified our lessons and teaching techniques to make use of the proper terminologies and prepared long term lesson plans to incorporate them into the norm.

Participants were also asked to describe how their classroom practice had changed through the course. Out of the 43 participants who responded, 95% responded with descriptions of changes in their perspectives and specific practical changes that were the result of their participation in the course. Out of these respondents, 76% gave highly detailed descriptions of the changes that took place, involving specific actions regarding their lesson planning, group work, and sustaining this through long-term action planning. This is highlighted through one participant describing that they now give their learners “different roles within a dialogic group”, four participants specifically mentioning the benefit of introducing ground rules for talk into their lessons, and another speaking about reviewing their lesson plans based on their action plan and goals for enhancing their dialogic practices. Many participants also noted their knowledge from the course resulting in a confidence to enact their action plans. For example, one participant explains: “I am now looking at controlled activities in a new way to look for the places where I can open these up for student-led dialogue… I also feel a renewed confidence or strengthened resolve to stand up for a dialogic approach.”

### Theme 6: Continuous adaptation

The ability of the course team to continuously adapt to the needs of the participants in order to produce a more meaningful course structure and content is the result of systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability.  This is described in Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 10, which recommends that courses build systematic monitoring and evaluation into their structure. Systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course was built into the course delivery because of its roots in research; however, we recommend every online TPD course has a clear theory of change and logic model from the outset. The future iteration of this course, as well as other similar courses using the Fundamentals MOOC as an example, should also ensure that systematic monitoring and evaluation should remain live throughout and following trials and cohorts, and feedback loops should continue to elicit the voices of all key stakeholders and participants. This approach resulted in the ability to immediately apply feedback into the delivery during the live cohort, and simplified processes to modify aspects of the course following the trial. This also led to the development of an institutional memory, which documents the lifespan of the course. It is noteworthy that the monitoring and evaluation of the Fundamentals MOOC trial is not yet complete. All participants will be sent a follow-up survey in the coming months to assess their practice again and see what changes, if any, have occurred. This will aid in the continued analysis of the impact of the course and will be considered in relation to necessary adaptations to the course structure and content. The practical outworking of this finding for participants, is that they should be empowered and encouraged to participate in the available monitoring and evaluation mechanisms as their voices, opinions, concerns and recommendations will inform the design of the course.

### Modifications to the design principles

Based on the evidence from this course trial, we recommend six modifications to the design principles:

**Design Principle 3: Offer opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration amongst participants**

Design Principle 3 should include the following three findings: (i) The research buddy system indicated a promising avenue for peer reflection, support and collaboration, which participants considered impactful for both their learning and retention. We recommend courses offer a similar peer-to-peer exchange. Courses should consider how to offer a balance of structure and flexibility for these exchanges and how to automate the matching process using strategic criteria based on feedback from previous trials. (ii) The discussion forum and other collaborative activities, outside of the live events, should be intentionally asynchronous. This means ensuring that their use is conducive to a number of participants participating at different times throughout the week or even full length of the course. (iii) Allow space for participants to lead events themselves and functionality for them to plan and orchestrate this. This will also aid in the access of live events for different time zones and the development of internal learning communities.

**Design Principle 4: Incorporate reflective activities for both local facilitators and their colleagues**

Design Principle 4 should additionally recommend that reflective activities be explicitly and strategically embedded in course videos, resources and activities, including the use of reflective journals or other related templates that can be adjusted based on the unique context of the participant. There should also be an adequate amount of time built into the course for participants to employ their reflections regarding the theoretical or practical materials in their settings.

**Design Principle 6: Consider the role of the participant in shaping the learning environment**

Based on the amount of interest from participants in participating in post-course research, Design Principle 6 should additionally recommend that participants are offered the opportunity to contribute to associated course-related research.

**Design Principle 9: Be intentional regarding the future of the course and consider whether and how scaffolding should be reduced for future iterations**

Design Principle 9 should include the success of a multiple course model, which has been shown to bring together a number of the design principles. This course offers a rare opportunity for practitioners to reflect on theory prior to engaging in a more practical inquiry (Course 2) and eventually pedagogical leadership in their setting (Course 3). The expectation is that this results in an environment that progressively requires less facilitator support.

**Design Principle 10: Build systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course into its structure**

Design Principle 10 should consider the automation of monitoring and evaluation processes to accommodate a larger participant base. This could also aid in automating the ladder of support available for participants, which strengthens the potential of design principle 9 to scale back support and reduce scaffolding from facilitators.

**All design principles**

In addition to their current iteration with the above modifications, we recommend that the ten design principles are additionally articulated for course participants themselves. This should include how participants can leverage the design principle in order to enhance their experience and learning in the course. This can then be recalled during data collection to elicit their feedback regarding any further modifications required.

## Conclusions

### Summary of key findings

Through the launch and associated research of the Fundamentals MOOC, this study found the following ways to leverage technology and online learning to provide impactful, theoretically informed professional learning opportunities for educators: (i) the development and curation of course content and resources that are adequately structured in order to provide support to participants, yet customisable enough to promote localisation, (ii) providing collaborative opportunities between course participants through the forum, live events and research buddy system particularly when it involved challenging one another’s perspectives, and (iii) providing opportunities for participants to engage in reflection of the content through the customisable weekly reflective templates and final learning report. Impact appeared to be strengthened when the ten design principles were met, as described in all five themes, which indicates that the highest impact can come when these themes and design principles are addressed together in course design and delivery. Impact included changes in the ways that participants thought about their practice, and the enactment of theory into their practice. Participants also vocalised their desire to continue to be involved in the course community, which was a core feature of the mechanical MOOC model and the dialogic conceptual framework of the course. This is because the course aimed to not only impart new knowledge but to also curate a teacher community of practice.

The findings from this course trial support and build on all ten design principles presented in Brugha and Hennessy (2022). In particular, the evidence strongly supports Design Principles 1, 3, 4, 7,  8 and 10 in order to leverage technology and online learning to provide impactful professional learning opportunities for educators. In addition to the original design principles, we recommend: (i) the use of an intentional and structured collaboration system to include a research buddy exchange or similar and further participant ownership in arranging live events, (ii) the inclusion of explicit reflective activities throughout the course, (iii) the inclusion of participants in post-course research, (iv) the use of a multiple course model for bringing together the design principles and enhancing scalability and sustainability, (v) the automation of monitoring and evaluation processes, and (vi) reframing the design principles so that they are relevant to both course providers and course participants.

This research addresses a gap in the literature, which requires more rigorous evidence regarding investigations based in theory of the processes of teacher learning in oTPD, design considerations, and the accompanying impact on teacher practice (Lay et al., 2020). This research addresses this need in two ways: (i) through building on and refining theoretically-informed design principles for oTPD that promote teacher agency; (ii) through the focus on the outcomes of the approach on teachers’ perceptions and practice.

## Limitations

A number of limitations in the study are noteworthy. The open access nature of the course is an essential element of the mechanical MOOC model, but this makes monitoring the course participation more difficult as it depends on participant willingness to participate in the study. This also made it more challenging to capture the voice of the inactive participant as well as the participants who began and did not finish the course. Similarly, the pre- and post-course questionnaires were not mandatory for participants to complete in order to access the course materials. As such, it was impossible to ascertain whether there were other users who completed the course materials, whose information and experience in the course was not captured by the research tools. The submission of reflective reports served as an indicator of course completion in some way, but it was entirely possible for educators to have gone through the materials, adapted them into their practice without our knowledge. We consider this to be unlikely but this remains an important area for future research to engage with; i.e. how MOOCs can reliably indicate engagement.

In addition, the reliability of the self-audit tool that participants filled out during the pre- and post-course surveys presented a challenge in accurately measuring impact. This is firstly because participants self-reported the change, which can have challenges regarding reliability but secondly, and interestingly, this is also because participants' scores were often lower when they had more significant participation in the course. As articulated in Theme 4, we hypothesise that this is due to increased educator understanding of deeper educational dialogue practice, which enables more critical self-reflection. This is an interesting insight into the self-audit tool, and indeed strengthens the argument for the reliability of self-reporting, but makes it problematic for accurate impact measurement as part of the research tools for the present study.

## Future research

This research has led to a number of further questions and points of interest that should be explored in future studies. This includes: (i) The use of the discussion forum, including how educators collaborate together in a theoretically-driven course. This will be analysed and presented in more detail in an upcoming publication with the Working Paper group referenced above, composed of the facilitators and participants from the Fundamentals MOOC. This will employ a coding scheme to explore the new opportunities for dialogue that participation in an online platform creates. (ii) The legacy impact of participation in the course series. This will be explored through a legacy survey and interviews that will be conducted in the coming months to track impact as it has surfaced after the course. This will be reported on in future research, which will also explore catalytic impact of the other courses in the series and the extent to which the impact is sustainable and scalable. (iii) Further potential mitigation factors for addressing barriers to participation and completion.

The Educational Dialogue MOOC series presents a unique opportunity to continue to analyse the engagement in and impact of oTPD. Wider continued critical exploration of how online TPD can offer support for the formation and sustainability of teacher communities of practice is needed to adjust and build on the design principles. This should additionally include how to use technology to support teachers to enact high quality educational dialogue in their classrooms in order to improve learning outcomes and 21st century skills through a dialogic approach to TPD.

## Further design considerations

This section presents an overview of further design considerations of oTPD and implications for related programmes. This extends from the preceding two chapters, and includes insights from key sector informants from their interview transcripts. Their names have been provided with their permission. 

As the findings from this research indicate, while technology can provide new forms of dialogue between practitioners and enhance access to professional learning opportunities to a wide range of educators globally, technology has also introduced new variables and barriers such as digital literacy and issues regarding access to connectivity and devices. Michael (Cambridge University Press) similarly noted that “initially technology was an enabler and now it is a barrier. The functionality is not good enough to facilitate the types of human interactions we need”. Using technology to pursue learning opportunities may also be stressful for participants who are experiencing virtual fatigue, particularly following the Covid-19 pandemic. As Lisa (Generation Global) pointed out, “using technology can be emotionally, physically and mentally exhausting”. Katherine (MIT Media Lab) recognised this exhaustion as well and recommended “creating an authentic community that practitioners want to be a part of… Participants need a shared identity with trust amongst them”. This reflects the importance of fostering a dialogic ethos and culture of inclusion and respect.

The above findings point to the importance of oTPD design placing the pedagogy first, and then fitting the technology around this to promote the aims of the course. Interestingly, it is often the most simplified structures and technologies that can have the highest usage and strongest impact. Lisa noted that they use WhatsApp in their oTPD courses: “it is not revolutionary but the way we use WhatsApp groups is contextual”. Dirk (P2PU) similarly recommended prioritising simplicity and navigability in technology design: “If you think about an LMS, it is often complicated with the content paywalled, and there are a lot of traditional components like quizzes after each section. This is formal and restrictive.” Michael similarly noted how significant investments in studios and equipment to create engaging knowledge products for learners did not have the return on investment that was perhaps anticipated. He explained that this “is not engaging and loses the human element. Learners might prefer the low-tech options.” This exemplifies the importance of user-centred design and understanding the needs of the learners, their preferences regarding technology, and their prior experiences with it as it relates to their learning and collaboration with others. If the aim is to create a community, Michael noted that “something recorded simply on a phone feels very human and natural” as opposed to high-tech equipment. This was echoed in the data, with MOOC participants in the KIIs stating that they enjoyed the more ‘undone’ components of the course videos, which made them feel like we were having a conversation instead of me providing information (as articulated by MOOC participant, trial 1, KII transcript). The technology utilised in mechanical MOOCs leverages this understanding and focuses on what makes the most sense and has the highest relevance for the users.

Through having technology components that learners are already familiar with, this can increase their capacity to engage in collaborative work and peer-to-peer dialogue. As Lisa noted, “It is quite hard to sustain human interpersonal relationships with hundreds of people” especially when the objective is to create a dialogue. This means not broadcasting learning products, but rather creating avenues for collaboration and co-construction of knowledge. Lisa explained a peer learning strategy they employ through “having participants lead different parts of the course”. 

Regarding the ways in which technology can support the development of a teacher community of practice, Grif (P2PU) observed that the ability to control one’s own space online via platforms like mechanical MOOCs that enable teacher agency contributes to forming a community. This goes beyond participants creating this for themselves (for example, forming WhatsApp groups to engage with their peers following the end of a course), and there is instead a need for course design to incorporate connections between practitioners following the end of a cohort. Michael also recommends that there is an intentional element to the design for post-course collaboration and that the facilitation of further connections between participants ensures “diversity exists within communities of practice without taking ownership of them or over-designing”.

Katherine built on this and noted that design constraints are critical to explore, especially when the aim is to provide learners with agency and ensure their voices remain central to the programme design and facilitation. She recommended incorporating easily adaptable resources and opportunities and frameworks for reflective thought. This resonates with the notion of scaffolding, as articulated in Design Principle 2.

The regulatory environment and amount of institutional support and alignment with the course pedagogy of focus and its delivery model deeply affected participants’ uptake of the materials and the implementation of those materials into their practice. As Lisa also explained, “Designing a course and offering it for free is not enough. Teachers need recognition from their school, communities, and to see that their time spent on the materials is valued”. Katherine offered specific questions for course designers to consider regarding this: 

Is there support at the district level for teachers to spend the time to think deeply about these research questions? Are there supports in place to help them feel empowered? Otherwise, if you build a tool, it is only going to be able to be engaged with by teachers who have the most comfortable positions or have more time.

In addition to the design principles identified above, the importance of the role of the local facilitator continued to emerge as critical in discussions regarding scalability, sustainability and impact in these conversations. This relates back to the mechanical model and the focus on leveraging technology for enhancing community not only globally but within the local settings of practitioners as well. These insights provide greater clarity for the findings that emerged from the data analysis and substantiate the design principles. They also help provide further implications for policy and practice.
