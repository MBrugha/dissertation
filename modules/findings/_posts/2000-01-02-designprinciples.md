# Forming and testing design principles

This dissertation explored whether and how a mechanical MOOC on educational dialogue can afford new, sustainable and scalable opportunities for local facilitators and practitioners to collaborate, reflect together, support one another and share their learning and practice. Drawing on the findings from the intervention, ten design principles were developed for scalable and sustainable online professional development course models and communities of practice that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment, and that view educators as valuable creators and contributors to professional learning resources.

The first iteration of design principles was published as an article in a special issue of Irish Educational Studies on Digital Education Futures: Design for Doing Education Differently. This page provides a summary of the formation and initial testing of the design principles.

## Introduction

Educational dialogue involves co-constructing knowledge where learners build on each other’s dialogue and ideas through posing open questions, reasoning, justifying and critically evaluating (Alexander, 2008). This allows learners to understand from seeing others’ points of view and fosters collaborative learning. A growing body of international research has emerged over the last five decades that indicates dialogic methods in the classroom lead to improved performance in learners’ content knowledge, text comprehension, and reasoning capabilities (Clarke et al., 2016). Furthermore, evidence indicates that dialogic teaching can increase learners’ capacity for dialogue and reflective thought as well as develop subject-specific knowledge (Alexander et al., 2017; Howe et al., 2019) and critical reasoning skills (Mercer, 2008; Wegerif et al., 1999). Other research (Howe et al., 2019) has importantly concluded that developing a supportive classroom ethos, with active participation ideally supported by agreed ground rules, provides the foundation for dialogue to flourish. In classrooms where ideas were frequently elaborated and queried/challenged under these conditions, some significant student learning gains occurred.

Teacher professional development (TPD) programmes offer an opportunity to strengthen the quality of teaching and through this, the educational outcomes of learners (Hattie, 2009). TPD programmes can therefore be an effective avenue to support teachers to develop dialogic approaches in their classroom practices. The format of TPD, however, deserves consideration and the role of technology mediation and online learning for the provision of TPD stands to be better understood. This study is based on the premise that technology presents new affordances and potential benefits to professional learning, including wider access, opportunities for reflection, and more effective collaboration (Dille & Røkenes, 2021). As a result there is considerable urgency with respect to the current context of Covid-19 where a significant amount of professional learning has pivoted to be online, to better understand the ways in which technology can be leveraged to develop effective TPD regarding educational dialogue and supportive practitioner communities. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are one such opportunity for online professional development for teachers that offer open access and collaboration between an unlimited number of practitioners internationally. They are the subject of heated debate in educational research, and the literature presents a number of potential challenges that require consideration:

1. The new digital literacies needed, varied prior experiences with technology, and a lack of technical support in gaining the necessary digital skills (Major et al., 2018).
2. Infrastructure constraints and unequal access to technology, particularly in low-resource contexts (Haßler et al., 2018).
3. Challenges regarding the translation and localisation of materials, with pre-determined and inflexible content that is not localised for users (Knox, 2013; MacDonald, 2008; Major et al., 2018; Partridge et al., 2011).

In response to this, mechanical MOOCs offer a different model. A bespoke separate platform is built for each course with the use of open source software and it is conceptualised as a community home base for learning. The model uses constructionism as its conceptual framework, which builds on Jean Piaget’s epistemological theory of constructivism and advocates for student-centred, discovery learning where students use information they already know to acquire more knowledge. For example, Seymour Papert’s constructivist theory of psychology take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than a transmission of knowledge. This suggests that learning is most effective when learners are tasked with activities that involve constructing a meaningful product or artefact.

The focus for this paper is specifically on using technology to create and support practitioner communities of practice through designing TPD for local facilitators of these communities. Local facilitators are practitioners who take on a leadership role to coordinate and support colleagues in developing their dialogic practices. They facilitate local communities of practice within their own settings, while simultaneously engaging in and building their own through online TPD. The research reported here builds on recent research conducted by the Toolkit for Systematic Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) collective on the critical role of the local facilitator (Hennessy et al., 2021). Offering a course for local facilitators serves to strengthen the scalability and sustainability of impact based on the evidence from Hennessy et al. (2021), which indicates that facilitators help to establish and support learning communities in their own institutions where they:

1. Set their own contextualised accountability mechanisms with the teachers they convene,
2. Are well placed to translate resources based on the needs of their colleagues and their context,
3. Can help to embed dialogic pedagogy in the school culture through increasing teacher buy-in, and
4. Effectively bridge the gap between research and practice.

Drawing on the findings from the three course trials, 10 design principles are offered for scalable and sustainable online professional development course models and communities of practice that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment, and that view educators as valuable creators and contributors to professional learning resources.

## Methods
Data for this paper are derived from:

1. The first two live trials of the MOOC (February–March 2021 & October–November 2021);
2. The MOOC taken as a self-paced module (i.e. available data from outside of the live cohorts); and
3. The pilot study involving the online Practitioner Professional Development (PPD) course run through the Faculty.

The research collected and analysed mixed-methods data from participants, including:

1. **MOOC website analytics**, collected from all site users between February-November 2021 (377 unique users) and analysed using descriptive statistics and heat maps of website traffic to explore user behaviour.
2. **A pre-course questionnaire** (n=82) and **post-course questionnaire** (n=27): The pre-course questionnaires included items regarding participants’ demographic data, their prior experiences with the use of technology for their professional learning, and their familiarity with educational dialogue. The post-course questionnaires sought information regarding participants’ experiences in the course, key successes and barriers for their participation, and the impact of the course on their practice. A self-audit was included in the questionnaires for these non-facilitator participants in order to capture changes in practice following the completion of the course in which they conducted a reflective inquiry into their practice. All questionnaire responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and triangulated with the other data sources to explore participant demographics, their behavioural and cognitive engagement in the course, and recommendations for course improvement.
3. **Discussion forum contributions** (185 posts from 25 participants in three separate forums for each trial): Discussion forum contributions comprised original contributions from participants, their responses to others’ posts, and their ‘likes’ of posts. These were analysed using frequency counting and thematically using constant comparison methods.
4. **Key informant interviews (KIIs)** with course participants (n=12): KIIs were conducted to ascertain further usage, engagement and impact data and were again analysed thematically using constant comparison methods. This was inductive, exploring the data for patterns, themes and categories and deriving codes from the data rather than having a predetermined set (Guest, MacQueen & Namey, 2012; Hilliard, 2013; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009).

Triangulation was performed between the different data sources through cross-examining themes between data sources and exploring connections and contradictions.

## Findings

### Course participation
The PPD course had 15 participants, all of whom were educational practitioners of some kind, working at school or higher education level. Demographic and engagement data from the PPD course were analysed for this study to form user profiles, which informed the design of the MOOC. These analyses focused on prior experiences with technology, perceptions of the use of technology for professional learning, and engagement in digitalised resources and online collaborative tools. Table 4 presents an overview of the course participants.

The first trial of the mechanical MOOC in February/March 2021 had 39 registered participants, 6 of whom completed all course requirements and were issued Certificates of Completion. The second trial in October/November 2021 had 28 participants register through completing the pre-course survey and at the time of writing , 6 participants completed the course requirements and will gain certificates. Because the surveys were not mandatory to complete in order to access the materials, it is difficult to ascertain whether there were other users who engaged in and completed the course materials, without their data being collected. Indeed, the MOOC user analytics suggest that significantly more new users (over 300 unique users) accessed the weekly materials than those who completed registrations. In addition, there were examples of course participants who were actively engaged in the discussion forum and live events and yet did not submit their final learning products in time to receive a certificate. One of these participants was interviewed in order to capture their perspective and the impact of the course on their practice despite not having fulfilled the formal obligations to receive certification. Their insights offer an important perspective for the design principles of the course. It will also be important, however, for future research to engage with the experience of the ‘inactive’ participant and the impact of the course on their practice in further detail.
The pre-course registration questionnaires for the MOOC showed that participants came from a range of backgrounds and had different motivations for taking the MOOC. These include developing skills for facilitation (referenced by 75% of participants), gaining a deeper understanding of educational dialogue and applying more theory into their practice (46%), obtaining certification and participating in continuing professional development more generally (17%), networking and engaging with other professionals (21%), and an interest in exploring a mechanical MOOC (17%). All participants who completed the course cited gaining a deeper understanding of educational dialogue as a motivation for them taking the course. Participant demographics from the MOOC are presented in Table 5.

	Taken a MOOC, but unrelated to profession	4%
	Not taken a MOOC previously but familiar with them	29%
	Not taken a MOOC before and not familiar with them	21%

Most participants were female (57%) and between the ages of 26 and 35 (38%). Participants were based in many different countries globally and were educators at different levels (ECE, primary/elementary, secondary/A-level, higher education) and the subjects they taught ranged considerably although there appeared to be a considerable number of mathematics and science teachers (approximately 50% of participants). Most (46%) reported that they had taken a MOOC before, including one for their professional development although a considerable number of participants had not taken a MOOC and were unfamiliar with them (21%). The participants who completed the course requirements all had taken a MOOC before, including one for their professional development.
The materials were also available as a self-paced module in between the two MOOC trials, however user site analytics suggest mild traffic that engaged with the course sub-modules and even lower traffic that indicates transitions from one sub-module to the next (i.e. participants moving through the sub-modules in order). There were limited posts on the discussion forum (five posts from five participants) reserved for self-paced participants, however six participants completed the registration form in the Week 1 materials. The form responses showed similar variation in participants’ levels and subjects of teaching, their prior experiences with MOOCs, as well as their geographical location, as in the PPD course and live MOOC cohort, as shown in Table 6. None of the respondents shared their gender on the questionnaire.

	Europe & Central Asia	33%

	Not taken a MOOC before and not familiar with them	50%

They described their motivations for taking the course as developing skills for facilitation (referenced by 50% of participants), gaining a deeper understanding of educational dialogue and applying more theory into their practice (33%), and obtaining certification and participating in continuing professional development more generally (67%). Regardless of the desire to obtain a certificate, no participants who selected this as their motivation for taking the course received certificates of completion from either the self-paced version or the live cohort.
One of the core findings in the study was the importance of collecting and documenting information regarding participants’ demographics and prior experiences with technology and educational dialogue in order to ensure that the structure and materials were relevant (see Design Principles 6 and 7). Analysis regarding relevance was conducted using all data sources following each trial of the course in order to capitalise on the intervention cycles, using findings to make adjustments to the course structure and materials.
Course engagement
Across the three trials, participants engaged in the courses in different ways, which were analysed using all available data sources. The analysis of course engagement data resulted in 10 themes which emerged as important findings and areas for consideration regarding the course structure, materials and conceptual framework. These themes are accompanied by 10 associated design principles which are presented in the following discussion section.
Theme 1. Motivation and accountability
The reliance on learner self-motivation to consistently engage in the course materials each week was a challenge throughout all trials. Integrated accountability mechanisms that were considered particularly successful by participants in the post-course questionnaires and interviews were the weekly emails and personalised check-ins, as well as the development of internal learning communities, although this took place at a micro level because of the small size of the cohorts. MOOC site analytics indicate a significantly higher volume of traffic and clicks on all elements of the course during live trials than during the self-paced period. Participants mentioned via questionnaires and interviews that the live cohorts provided them with momentum in completing course components. Success was linked with the course facilitator providing ad hoc support and adjusting the weekly resources and tools based on their unique needs for strengthening retention through establishing a relationship with the participants. Participants in the trials who shared their learning with others also noted this as contributing to their momentum: “Knowing that posts were read carefully and responded to thoughtfully meant that I invested more time in clarifying my thinking before submitting” (Participant, MOOC Trial 1).
Theme 2. Flexibility and structure
Balancing flexibility and structure emerged as a critical component of the course design and materials. Participants acknowledged that the flexibility whereby they could access a ladder of support where needed (e.g. through additional reading materials and links, the discussion forum, joining the live events like the virtual co-working spaces, via email with the course facilitator) equipped them to apply the learning from the course to their own setting. There was also a balance of flexibility and structure within accountability structures where participants were able to set their own timescales over the weekly submodules but maintain momentum through the 6-week cohorts. Balancing structure and flexibility also related to the course materials and resources. In the initial course design, activities and templates were left relatively unstructured to invite participants to dictate the shape depending on their contexts. However, while half of the survey respondents said that they preferred the unstructured template, the other half wanted something significantly more structured. This tension resulted in the development of a semi-structured toolkit in the second trial with open-ended questioning so that the learning outputs could be unique to individual settings. These structured yet customisable tools and resources were pivotal in stimulating and supporting the development of the participants’ facilitation plans, and they were cited as a key strength of the course by participants from varied geographies and contexts.
Theme 3. Dialogue and collaboration amongst course peers
Participants in all trials noted a strong desire to collaborate and communicate with their course peers, connecting practices across geographies and different contexts. A common response to the post-course survey for all trials was a request for more opportunities for collaboration between course peers. Yet, there remained much to be desired from the engagement in the communication and collaborative features by participants, particularly regarding spontaneous dialogue. Communication channels for the course included the discussion forum, live events such as coding tutorials and virtual coworking spaces, and personalised communications with the course facilitator. The forum was used at different levels of intensity between the different courses; however, there was limited use of the forum overall with particularly low use for spontaneous dialogue. Most posts were in response to questions posed by the course facilitator. Yet for those participants that used the forum, they felt that their contributions were useful to their overall learning in the course through the use of questions posed by the course facilitator related to the weekly thematic foci. This was articulated by one participant as follows:
I like how each week there was an expectation of what I should post on the forum but also how I felt I was also able to stray ‘off-topic’ if needed. I enjoyed reading posts from other participants to learn from their experience and hear about their projects. (Participant, MOOC Trial 1)
A participant from the PPD course agreed that the discussion forum acted as an avenue for exchange: “It was the ‘place’ where I most exchanged with my classmates and that was enriching” (Participant, PPD course). Participants who disagreed that the forum was helpful to their learning shared that they did not spend a lot of time engaging with it and when exploring the post records, had not posted at all. Despite the poor use of the forum, areas of success included having both synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication available between course participants and between participants and the course facilitator, accommodating different preferences, as well as having these communication tools and activities articulated explicitly as part of the course. Explicit inclusion in the course also enabled the systematic monitoring of their successes and challenges to be more streamlined.
Theme 4. Practitioners as reflective professionals
Reflective activities for participants were considered a key success of the course by participants, who noted that their opportunity to reflect via the course activities and tools had significant impact on their practice. This in large part drew on the conceptual framework of T-SEDA, in which reflective inquiry is central, but also emerged independently of explicit reflective activities, suggesting that the practitioners were able to use the course materials to develop their own methods of active reflection. Examples included the uses of the self-audit tool and discussion forum. The self-audit was designed as a tool for the non-facilitator participants to monitor changes in dialogic practice through asking practitioners the same questions before and after they complete a reflective inquiry. It is also a tool that the local facilitators were encouraged to use with the colleagues they were facilitating. Results indicated that it offered a reflective activity in itself because many participants rated themselves as using fewer forms of dialogic teaching after taking the course; upon being asked to compare their own pre- and post-course self-audits, participants speculated that through the course they had become more aware of what dialogic teaching was and that their earlier understandings had been more superficial. The discussion forum emerged as another space for reflection. It offered different channels for discussing each week’s theme for both the PPD course and the MOOC. Questions were posed to the group for participants to address in their posts, however several participants at the end of the course who were significant contributors to the forum noted an additional benefit, that their posts served as reflective journaling: “It helped me reflect regularly of the new notions I had learned or papers I had read, probably more in depth that I would have on my reflective journal as there was interaction with the others” (Participant, PPD course).
Theme 5. Practitioners as creators
Participants in all trials of the course shared their need for accessing contextualised resources specific to their settings. They felt that the course would benefit from a dedicated resource bank providing a range of subject- and age-specific resources for them to draw and – importantly – build on. As part of the course requirements to receive a certificate of completion, participants were asked to develop an artefact; for local facilitators this was a comprehensive facilitation plan that addressed each of the weekly themes and considerations (e.g. how they gain teacher buy-in, how they will support teachers throughout the reflective inquiry process, etc.), and for non-facilitator participants this was a completed reflective inquiry. These completed learning products, with participant permission, acted as new resources for the next trial. As the course continues to run, more artefacts will be added to this resource base where new participants can build on them and share their own learning products. Participants noted that creating research projects and products impacted their practice, which many continued to lead themselves following the end of the course. For example, “this course has prompted a joint project between myself and my course director and I feel that I will be able to contribute to make an impact on our course going forward” (Participant, MOOC Trial 1).
Theme 6. The role of the participant in shaping the learning environment
Success was seen in collaborating with participants in all phases of the research; during the pilot phase, the design of the course, the live cohorts, and during and after each subsequent trial. It was also critical for the research to capture the continued experiences from prior participants in order to document the intended and catalytic impact of the course. This data was used to inform further iterations of the course structure and materials and the course continues to be informed by participants’ data. Collaboration was also used to direct the content of live events, where the focus was decided in conversation with participants and weekly materials were adapted by the course facilitator where needed. This enhanced accountability through creating highly relevant materials based on participants’ goals for the course (see Design Principles 1 and 6).
Theme 7. Accessibility
The concept of accessibility presented in this theme encompasses a range of constraints felt by participants in participating in and completing the course: (i) participants with disabilities, (ii) varied prior experiences with technology, (iii) varied levels of familiarity with concepts related to educational dialogue, and (iv) issues regarding available infrastructure and internet connectivity. This was primarily analysed through data from the pre-course questionnaire, key informant interviews, and user testing by a participant with a disability. The data informed the design of the MOOC platform and led to the development of a user guide for the course and detailed guidance regarding the use of the online course components. It was also considered necessary to have a highly simplified and easy-to-navigate platform, which resulted in the removal of peripheral information, having the same predictable and streamlined format for each weekly submodule, and ensuring that site analytics were monitored to make changes as required. Course participants had varied levels of familiarity with educational dialogue, which necessitated a ladder of support from the course facilitator. This demanded significant ad hoc support in the live cohorts, however this will be scaled back following the launch of two other courses that will serve as foundational for the local facilitator’s course. Accessibility also included constraints associated with available infrastructure, including poor internet connectivity. While this course was not specifically designed for individuals who do not have access to reliable internet connectivity and infrastructure to participate, the research necessarily sought to explore the extent to which this course is inclusive. To address this, a case study is currently in development regarding a group of teachers from Sierra Leone, for whom a bespoke version of the course and toolkit is being developed and trialled, including offline versions of activities and tools. This will be reported in future.
Theme 8. Conceptual framework of the course
This course was never designed or run as a ‘training’, but rather it intends to be inquiry-based and an opportunity for reflective learning within a community of practitioners. A key component of the mechanical MOOC model and the use of the T-SEDA inquiry framework was therefore to rework the idea of traditional professional development. The conceptual framework of the course design is integral to sustainability and scalability of impact, but participants also noted that this framework was presented in a way that allowed them to enact it in their own practice as local facilitators. The practical outworking of this meant that they were able to reflect more deeply, individually and with their colleagues, on their practice and how they are best placed to research this.
Theme 9. Sustainability and scalability
Sustainability and scalability were central considerations for the course from the outset of the study, integrating associated questions in all data collection tools. Many of the prior themes mentioned in this section contribute to the potential sustainability and scalability of the course (e.g. ensuring that there are integrated accountability mechanisms, having flexible yet structured activities and tools, offering opportunities for meaningful dialogue, etc.), however the data suggest that this will take a considerable amount of time as it directly relates to establishing a community of practice in tandem with running the course and attracting more participants. The strongest related finding is the integral need for a course facilitator as participants were (mostly) unable to direct the learning themselves, although they showed considerable interest in doing so in future and in directing learning in their own contexts. This is an area in which upcoming research will engage in greater depth in order to better understand ways in which scaling back support can be systematised.
Theme 10. Monitoring and evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation was a significant component of the course design in order to ensure that appropriate methods were in place to capture detailed and relevant information that address the research questions. This included systematic feedback from participants, which informed adaptations to the course, and which recognises the participants as reflective professionals. These systematic feedback loops and detailed user experiences and engagement resulted in an efficient system of leveraging learning for new iterations of the course.
5.1.5. Discussion
Drawing on the above thematic findings, 10 design principles have been drafted for scalable and sustainable online professional development programmes for local facilitators that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment, and view educators as valuable creators and contributors to professional learning resources and environments. Design principles offer guidance and key considerations regarding areas of success and challenges to inform future iterations of the current course, as well as other similar courses, noting of course that no two courses are identical, and that adaptation is key (Bakker, 2018). The design principles use van den Akker’s (1999) format through offering characteristics and procedures for the course in order to design an online professional development intervention for the purpose of building and sustaining educator communities of practice globally in which teachers are considered and used as reflective creators.
These design principles directly relate to each of the 10 themes that emerged from the data regarding the ways in which participants engaged in the course structure, materials and conceptual framework. Each design principle provides key characteristics that courses should incorporate, the processes by which these characteristics can be incorporated, and the evidence that supports this. It is noteworthy that while these design principles are based on the evidence provided by the two trials of the MOOC and the PPD course pilot study, they will continue to be refined over the next year of research. Note also that these design principles have been developed specifically for courses designed for local facilitators, however they can also be considered during the development of other similar courses. Indeed, they have been used to inform the design of two new mechanical MOOCs that are currently in development for educators who are not local facilitators, but who are practitioners interested in learning more about educational dialogue. These courses are set to launch in early 2022, and there will be associated research to build on the following design principles.
Design Principle 1. Integrate accountability mechanisms in the design of the course
There is a clear need for integrated accountability mechanisms in the design of the course for participants to consistently engage in and complete the materials. While the data for this course and the literature more widely (e.g. see Rodriguez et al., 2020) shows that retention continues to be a significant challenge for MOOCs, the learning communities afforded by the mechanical MOOC model should be leveraged for courses with a growing number of participants. This model acts as a community hub in which learning communities can be easily derived and scaled as an explicit part of the course. The data from this course also suggest that accountability can be enhanced through offering a mixture of live and self-paced options, offering meaningful opportunities for participants to interact and collaborate (see Design Principle 3), and establishing a relationship with participants, which aids in successfully implementing all design principles. For their course, Lay et al. (2020) similarly found that the measures they put in place to get to know participants resulted in an increase in participant retention and completion. However, research by Reparaz et al. (2020) suggests that instructor support is not a relevant factor for MOOC retention so it may therefore be what instructor support can impact that creates further retention.
Design Principle 2. Provide a balance of flexibility and structure in the design of learning pathways and materials
The varied backgrounds and prior experiences participants had using educational dialogue in their practice necessitated a flexible course design that is accessible for different settings alongside individualised needs assessments. This allowed for the selection of appropriate learning pathways with a ladder of support for participants to access as needed (e.g. supporting participants in the challenges they are met with via the discussion forum, live events, email, etc.). This is in line with research from Dille and Røkenes (2021) who note that “a ‘one size fits all’ design is an illusion for [online] TPD. To capture their internal factors in relation to the activity, a key finding from our review is that scaffolding is critical in teachers’ professional development phases” (p. 14). The course materials and resources should also offer a blend of structure and flexibility with customisable options. In their review, Dille and Røkenes (2021) similarly found that while some teachers preferred more structure, several studies indicated the strong preference of teachers to have a space to experiment (e.g. Brennan et al., 2018, as cited in Dille & Røkenes 2021). They go on to state that “enhanced flexibility can balance individual needs with online programmes’ contents, thus meeting the diversity between the participants in the same online programmes” (p. 15). This was in line with the data for this study where participants from diverse contexts were able to engage with the flexible content.
Design Principle 3. Offer opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration amongst participants
Participants were keen to share their knowledge and learn from others in the course, yet there was poor engagement with most of the communication and collaborative features in the course. This lack of meaningful dialogue and learning through dialogue is a challenge shared by many online courses and traditional learning platforms, which makes the role of the local facilitator integral in creating those dialogues within their own settings amongst the colleagues they intend to support and convene. Successful methods for encouraging dialogue and collaboration include having synchronous and asynchronous modes of communication explicitly as part of the course design and leveraging technology to support interactive learning by developing new forms of dialogue and opening a ‘dialogic space for reflection’ (Wegerif et al., 2017).
Design Principle 4. Incorporate reflective activities for both local facilitators and their colleagues
Inquiry-based learning positions teacher agency and empowerment as central in the design and implementation of the course. Rather than a TPD programme with a designated ‘expert’ imparting knowledge on subject or pedagogical content, a key component of the course is that it is a continuous process in which dialogue-focused, explicitly contextualised inquiry is led by practitioners themselves supported by local facilitators. The course provided tools for local facilitators to use while convening their colleagues that promote continued reflection and include ways that practitioners can continually reassess and adapt their practice. The course also benefited from the inclusion of reflective activities for local facilitators themselves, through the discussion forum contributions and customisable templates, in which they reflected on their practice in detail.
Design Principle 5. Offer opportunities for participants to create and share artefacts
The mechanical MOOC model aligns with the trend towards more creator platforms that are emerging in online professional learning, which empowers individuals to create learning resources through acknowledging their expertise (Dille & Røkenes, 2021). Participants in both trials of the MOOC and the PPD course noted the benefit of creating research products relevant to their contexts, and also shared their desire for accessing learning from others through the use of a resource bank. In order to keep the course materials on the platform streamlined, this is ideally done through building on the resources already available on the edudialogue.org site and adding in an easily operated filter system as more resources are added. This should additionally provide functionality in which practitioners can build on the available resources and share adapted versions in a meaningful way. This refers to the local facilitator participants in the MOOC as well as the teachers that they intend to convene in their settings, in order to enable the growth of an educational dialogue community of practice that emphasises collaboration and the co-construction of knowledge.
Design Principle 6. Consider the role of the participant in shaping the learning environment
Collaboration with participants was actively and systematically conducted during the course design, implementation and evaluation, which resulted in a more relevant and engaging course and a stronger sense of agency and empowerment for the participants. This is in line with findings from Dille and Røkenes’ (2021) review that note teachers who have agency within online professional development courses and can help shape the development processes will likely have more extensive engagement in their professional development (e.g. Lowe & Holton III, 2005; Engeström & Sannino, 2010, as cited in Dille & Røkenes, 2021). The mechanical MOOC model builds on constructivist learning theories and emphasises the importance of participants in shaping learning spaces. In the case of this course for local facilitators, the learning space extends from the online course to their settings.
Design Principle 7. Position accessibility centrally in the design of the course
Access was cited as a barrier for participants to engage in and complete the course. This includes challenges associated with infrastructure and internet connectivity, digital literacy and varied prior experiences with technology, and different levels of familiarity with educational dialogue. This is a common challenge for MOOCs, and a lack of access may further exacerbate a digital divide and continue to marginalise the global south (e.g. see Liyanagunawardena et al., 2013). Through positioning accessibility as central during the course design process, many of these factors can be mitigated. The course benefited from requesting accessibility considerations during the registration process as well as capturing prior experiences taking online courses and concerns regarding accessing professional development online. This helped to ensure appropriate support methods were established for participants to be able to engage fully in the course.
Design Principle 8. Align the course model and platform with the pedagogy of focus
There is significant synergy between the model of the mechanical MOOC, the open source platform developed to host the course, the inquiry-based approach of T-SEDA, the focus on local facilitators as the primary participants in the course, and the principles and theory of educational dialogue. Specifically, these components interact well to emphasise facilitating teacher agency through establishing a sustainable and scalable community of practice in which practitioners from a range of contexts can access resources to adapt according to their setting. The MOOC, T-SEDA and dialogic principles also all emphasise teachers as valuable creators and reflective professionals who learn through collaboration and connection of practice. This design principle ensures that the pedagogy is of central focus, rather than the technology.
Design Principle 9. Be intentional regarding the future of the course and consider whether and how scaffolding should be reduced for future iterations
The underpinning theoretical framework of mechanical MOOCs posits that courses should not be run as traditional training structures with experts, but rather run by a course facilitator who comes secondary to the community in directing the learning. Success has been seen in other similar mechanical MOOCs whereby highly engaged prior participants (often referred to as ‘champions’) organised learning communities to direct their foci within the course. There will likely always be a need for a course facilitator to run live cohorts, and the data from this study support this, but the support from the course facilitator can be scaled back once the community of practice is more established. This is similarly reported by Dille and Røkenes (2021), who notes the importance of withdrawing support once participants understand and are able to take on the learning activities either individually or with peers (e.g. Wittek, 2011, as cited by Dille & Røkenes, 2021).
Design Principle 10. Build systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course into its structure
The course benefitted from integrating monitoring and evaluation in the course design in order to ensure that future iterations of the course were informed by the experiences of participants. Questions for future participants should include details regarding teacher agency, empowerment, access, equity, sustainability and scalability. These questions and evaluation processes should also require very little input from research staff, e.g. through the use of integrated survey software with closed questions. It is imperative that the design of the research tools considers sustainability and scalability carefully, as noted in Theme 9 and Design Principle 9.
5.1.6. Conclusions and implications
The initial results from this study have implications and design considerations for future iterations of the course as well as other online courses both within the educational dialogue course series and beyond. These findings point to a number of key theoretical and operational components of online professional development designed to offer sustainable and scalable opportunities for local facilitators and practitioners to collaborate, reflect together, support one another and share their learning and practice. The thematic findings suggest the need for a balance of flexibility and structure in the course syllabus and materials, as well as systematic and consistent engagement with participants throughout the design, implementation and evaluation of online courses. It was clear that participants sought opportunities to shape their learning spaces and create their own artefacts, and that this had a positive impact on the sustainability and scalability of the course. The themes also indicate a strong desire from participants to participate in an established community of practice in which participants can collaborate, discuss, share, and reflect with one another. Findings also show that accessibility continues to remain a significant barrier in engagement in online learning, although there are ways to mitigate some of these challenges and this should continue to be central to the design of further online professional learning courses.
The 10 design principles articulated in this paper explore some of the key emerging themes from the completed trials in which the structure, content and conceptual framework of the course is considered in detail. Professional development interventions aiming to build and sustain educator communities of practice globally in which teachers are considered and used as reflective creators should consider and build on these characteristics and procedures.
Limitations to the research surfaced in different phases but largely include challenges regarding the MOOC intervention and research design. Participation in the course required strong internet connectivity as well as foundational digital skills in order to access the online course and interact with other participants. This excluded populations who did not have the infrastructure or skills required to participate, which was particularly the case in low-income countries where a range of barriers to MOOC participation have been well documented. While participants came from a range of contexts, as documented in the pre-course surveys, the cohorts were also small for the data collected, which may not have offered enough varied, real experiences of teachers taking on local facilitator roles. Participants also noted challenges regarding their availability and engagement with having to balance multiple demands and competing priorities, in addition to extreme circumstances in light of Covid-19 and the ensuing challenges in participants’ professional and personal lives. This offered a tension where the context of Covid-19 presented a need for rigorous evidence building of remote TPD programming that is flexible in its design, however teachers may not have been in an ideal position to embark on professional development at this difficult time.
Research design limitations included the study being highly complex with many human, cultural, and environmental factors. The methods sought to be varied in order to capture as many of these moving parts as possible, however large amounts of data were derived from different sources remotely, which offered particular challenges for the qualitative data. In addition, the use of a mechanical MOOC model emphasised removing as many barriers to participation as possible. This meant that none of the content from the course was locked, i.e. participants did not need to register in order to access the course materials. Because the questionnaires were voluntary, it was therefore not possible to know whether more participants were engaging in the course inactively.
This study has pointed to multiple areas for future research. Priority areas that will inform the design of two new courses, which are currently in development and will be available in the same series as this MOOC for local facilitators include: (i) The extent to which the impact seen in the course is scalable and sustainable, which will be researched through continued engagement with previous course participants. This will also seek to more accurately capture the voice of the ‘inactive’ participant who did not submit a final artefact but still engaged with the course materials. (ii) The extent to which the edudialogue.org community hub is used and the development of design principles regarding this community space for practitioners and researchers. (iii) Catalytic impact of local facilitation, i.e. the unintended and unanticipated impacts of local facilitation, beyond what is currently included in the impact assessment framework. (iv) Sustainability as it relates to considerations for scaling back support from the course facilitator for future live cohorts. (v) Mitigation factors for addressing limitations regarding accessibility, particularly regarding infrastructure and digital skills, through the development of a related case study.
This research study offers important areas of further consideration, particularly since new technology-focused professional development programmes and pilots are erupting through a number of initiatives. Across this landscape, the role of technology to support and reshape teacher professional development stands to be better understood with rigorous research.

5.2.2. Introduction
Online Teacher Professional Development (oTPD) opportunities have become increasingly prevalent, particularly since the Covid-19 pandemic (Hartshorne et al., 2020). While these online courses may offer continued support for the formation and sustainability of teacher communities of practice in a post-pandemic world, further research is required to develop and assess good practice. Specifically, design considerations are needed by the sector that promote teacher agency and empowerment through the delivery of theoretically informed oTPD that enables metacognitive change. This refers to the ways in which teachers can change the way that they think through engaging in oTPD.
In this study, we offer an analysis of a theoretically informed Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on educational dialogue to inform a deeper understanding of the delivery of a prevalent form of TPD via online platforms. We explore the format and structure of delivery and how this was shaped by the conceptual framework of the course, which draws on related research highlighting the need for teacher agency and the flexibility for teachers to be able to apply their learning to varied contexts (Hennessy et al., 2021). This research explores and reconsiders the ways in which we learn, teach and commune as professionals and learners. It also explicitly builds on previous research conducted by Brugha and Hennessy (2022), which offers ten design principles for scalable and sustainable online professional learning programmes that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment. These design principles were developed based on the evidence from trials of other MOOCs that are part of the same series as the course analysed for the present study. The wider framing of this research is supporting teachers to enact high quality educational dialogue in their classrooms in order to improve learning outcomes and a range of 21st century skills.
5.2.3. Research context
Educational dialogue
The work on educational dialogue has been generated by the unequal nature of classroom talk in which teachers and not learners are often the primary speakers in the classroom. Furthermore, when learners do speak it is typically not dialogically. In dialogue, participants actively and respectfully listen to each other, they contribute by sharing their ideas, justifying their contributions and engaging with others’ views. They explore and evaluate different perspectives and reasons, and knowledge is built collectively within a lesson – or over a series of interconnected lessons – through linking questions and contributions between speakers (Alexander, 2008; Wegerif et al., 1999). Educational dialogue means prioritising classroom relationships and recognising that education is an exchange between people (Alexander, 2008). In this exchange, learners have as much, if not more, of a role to play than educators. Taking a dialogic stance (Boyd & Markarian, 2011) can transform classroom and school cultures and can support learners by valuing forms of knowledge that learners bring with them (Flecha, 2015; Freire, 2000). Such knowledge is welcomed and taken seriously in a dialogic setting.
Research evidence on educational dialogue indicates that it is an effective pedagogy to enhance learning outcomes. It has been linked to improved content knowledge, text comprehension, and reasoning (Clarke et al., 2016; Alexander et al., 2017; Howe et al., 2019); and can increase critical reasoning skills (Mercer, 2008; Wegerif et al., 1999). A team at the University of Cambridge produced evidence about specific dialogic moves in teacher-student dialogue that are strongly associated with learning gains (Howe et al., 2019). They found the dialogic moves: building on ideas, invitations to build on ideas, and challenging and questioning others’ views, particularly powerful. Learning gains were only evident when these dialogic moves were made in the context of a supportive classroom, however, in which students actively participate and respectfully engage with others’ ideas.
Online teacher professional development and MOOCs
TPD programmes can be an effective avenue to support educators to develop their dialogic approaches. Increasingly, online models of delivery are being used for professional learning programmes, with potential benefits including wider and more inclusive access, as well as opportunities for international professional dialogue through shared reflection, which can lead to further collaboration (Dille & Røkenes, 2021). MOOCs in particular offer open access, including a no- or low-cost model and a wide, global reach. However, the quality and impact of professional learning in such programmes and online environments stands to be better understood. MOOCs, for example, have typically also been shown to have low retention rates (figures of 10% and lower retention rates are widely cited in the literature) and inflexible course content which cannot be easily contextualised for all participants; and they are only really accessible to those individuals with access to internet connectivity, devices and digital literacy to meaningfully participate in the course (Haßler et al., 2018; Major et al., 2018). In low-income countries they may be disproportionately used by the most privileged learners (Liyanagunawardena et al., 2013).
In their systematic review, Badali et al. (2022) identified motivational factors that influence retention and completion rates of MOOCs, which included academic, social, course, personal, professional and technological motives. This is noteworthy because it is clear that motivations go beyond academic pursuits, and there are other important motivators at play. This review also indicates the importance of enabling learner autonomy, competence and relatedness. The literature needs more evidence regarding defining engagement in MOOCs, however, and further understanding regarding how MOOC features contribute to a learner’s experience and impact changes in their perspectives and practice. As Hew et al. (2020) suggest, completion rates in MOOCs are not the only indication of MOOC success. Interpreting findings, whether that be from one course as a case study or a wider analysis of course statistics, should be done cautiously.
A mechanical MOOC offers an experimental alternative to the traditional MOOC format, and seeks to address some of the more common criticisms of MOOCs, as described above. A mechanical MOOC offers a bespoke platform for each course, which is built using open-source software on a limited budget through using existing technologies already known to users. The course platform is conceptualised and developed as a community learning hub, where learners are encouraged to collaborate and draw on their own and one another’s experiences and knowledge to acquire further knowledge. The mechanical MOOC model rejects instructionalism, i.e., an instructor ‘providing’ the education and instead embraces constructionism, which argues that the most effective learning activities are ones that result in the development of a meaningful product or artefact (Papert, 1980). This allows for a participant to take a course more than once and be able to continue to derive meaningful learning from it. Mechanical MOOCs also encourage the development of local learning communities within the course in order to localise and contextualise the course resources, offer opportunities for collaboration between course peers, and enhance accountability for course completion. For example, they seek to provide opportunities for project work based on the unique needs of the learners’ contexts in collaboration with peers through offering avenues to be matched with others taking the course who are in the same geographical location. For example, in MIT’s Media Lab’s Learning Creative Learning course, their model intentionally promotes building an ongoing learning community and includes grouping students to share ideas and provide feedback.  This course also promotes utilising ‘champions’ who are particularly engaged participants from previous cohorts to take on more leadership roles within the groups in order to build a culture of community-driven learning. The mechanical MOOC structure is the model used by all courses in the Educational Dialogue MOOC series that this study features.
Educational dialogue MOOC series
In order to strengthen educational dialogue practices internationally, a MOOC series was iteratively designed and developed for educators in schools and tertiary institutions. The series is based around some of the intersecting main research areas of the CEDiR (Cambridge Educational Dialogue Research) group, a research group within the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge that draws together a range of Faculty colleagues who are interested in dialogic pedagogy and aim to create and share high quality research.  The Educational Dialogue MOOC Series was developed as a means of data collection for two separate research studies:
1.	PhD research study: ‘Dialogic Online Teacher Professional Development: The Use of Technology to Build a Community of Practice in Educational Dialogue’, authored by Meaghan Brugha, which explores the intersection of technology and educational dialogue to enhance teacher professional development.
2.	Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship: ‘Trialling Dialogic Halaqah in Islamic education settings’, undertaken by Farah Ahmed, which evaluates if halaqah in Islamic schools and settings can support young Muslims in developing their shakhsiyah Islamiyah.
This paper presents an analysis of Course 1 from the Educational Dialogue MOOC Series, entitled ‘The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue’ (hereafter referred to as the Fundamentals MOOC). The Fundamentals MOOC was developed for practitioners interested in learning about the foundational theories behind educational dialogue, and was designed based on feedback from participants from other course trials in the series. The full suite of courses within the series is presented in Table 7. It was recommended to participants that they complete these courses in order. There are a total of six MOOCs in the series, which include three core MOOCs as well as three additional MOOCs for those working in Islamic settings. These six courses are currently operating at different stages of progress, as indicated in Table 7.
Table 7: Courses within the Educational Dialogue MOOC series
Core MOOCs	Progress	Halaqah MOOCs	Progress
Course 1: The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue	Trialled and available online	Course 1A: Dialogue in Islamic Classrooms: Using Halaqah to Develop Shakhsiyah	Trialled and available online 
Course 2: Conducting a Reflective Inquiry using the Toolkit for Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA)	Trialled as a course merged with Course 3	Course 2A: Evaluating the Quality of Halaqah Dialogue using T-SEDA	In development
Course 3: Supporting your Colleagues through Facilitation	Trialled and available online	Course 3A: Leading School-wide Change towards Dialogic Halaqah	In development
 
Each core course offers six weeks of materials, requiring approximately 2 to 3 hours from participants per week on course readings, activities and discussions. Each course can be taken as a ‘live course’ with a cohort of teachers or as a self-paced course at any time of the participant’s choosing. These courses are for all educators working with any age group including adults, working in any setting, full-time or supplementary schooling, who are interested in learning to use dialogic approaches to enhance their teaching and improve learning in their settings.
 These courses, particularly Courses 2 and 3, draw on the materials and learning of the Toolkit for Systematic Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) collective. T-SEDA is a toolkit that provides practical guidance and customisable templates for practitioners to systematically analyse the use of dialogue in their settings, reflecting on their own and their peers’ practices. All three MOOCs also draw on T-SEDA’s approach of practitioner-centred and practitioner-led inquiry-based learning. Educator feedback from initial trials indicated that effective inquiry-based learning in educational dialogue required a deeper engagement with the theories that underpin it. This feedback led to the development of the Fundamentals MOOC and presenting a full suite of courses for participants to work through as opposed to standalone courses. Although the course content in this MOOC is not inquiry-based as such, the course was constructed to support educators to engage in a reflective cycle which could be described as a ‘theoretical inquiry’, that is, iterative weekly reflection on how theoretical ideas could inform their classroom practice.
 The Fundamentals MOOC was designed with three objectives:
1.	Introduce learners to the key theorists, methodologies and debates in the field of educational dialogue across all phases of education.
2.	Equip learners to reflect on their own thinking about dialogic pedagogy and practices in their context.
3.	Prepare learners for further courses that support systematic reflective inquiry into their practice (i.e. Courses 2 and 3 in the series).
Each of the six weeks followed different theorists and themes and included activities to help practitioners reflect on these theories regarding their own practice. This approach aimed to support educators to engage more deeply with educational theory than they typically do in TPD, and in a more sustained way over a six-week period. Figure 7 presents a screenshot of the top of the Week 1 page of the course.
 
Figure 7: Screenshot of Fundamentals Week 1
The thematic foci for each of the six weeks is presented in Table 8. These theorists did not provide tutorial instructions and nor did we as the facilitators within the focal videos for the week, but rather these tutorials were used as tools for participants to think reflexively in order to apply the theories to their own settings.
Table 8: Fundamentals MOOC weekly breakdown
Week	Title	Description and objectives
1	An introduction to educational dialogue	Week 1 focuses on understanding the distinction between educational dialogue and classroom talk as well as the relationship of dialogue to thinking and learning. We provide an overview of terminology and outline the development of dialogic educational theories and practices. 
2	Robin Alexander - Taking a dialogic stance	Week 2 looks at the ways in which attending to classroom ethos can support educators and learners to take a dialogic stance.
3	Neil Mercer - Interthinking through exploratory talk	Week 3 builds on taking a ‘dialogic stance’, by exploring the mechanisms of how thinking happens and is developed through dialogue. We look at Neil Mercer’s use of the term ‘interthinking’ to explain how dialogue enables knowledge and understanding to be co-constructed, in particular through learners working in groups.
4	Sara Hennessy - Visualising classroom dialogue through dialogic moves	Week 4 presents research that enables educators to ‘see’ and evaluate the quality of classroom dialogue through dialogic moves. These are descriptors that qualify what kind of statement has been made, used by educational researchers to understand what types of dialogic practices and moves support children’s learning.
5	Rupert Wegerif - Opening up a dialogic space for reflection and agency	Week 5 expands our understanding of dialogic education by looking at the concepts of dialogic space and dialogic self. We ask, how might these dialogic ideas affect how we think about our classroom spaces, and the learners in our classrooms? Why might it be useful and important to ‘widen’ and ‘deepen’ dialogue in our classrooms?
6	Paulo Freire and Ramón Flecha - Transformative, holistic and decolonial approaches to dialogue	Week 6, the final week, looks at Paulo’s Freire’s conceptualisation of dialogic pedagogy which precedes much of the work looked at so far, and in many ways arises from a very different starting point. We then look at how Freire’s ideas have been picked up by Ramón Flecha and operationalised in schools worldwide. We build on one of the core questions from last week: Is dialogue a ‘western’ idea?
Design principles
In their study, Brugha and Hennessy (2022) offer ten design principles for scalable and sustainable online professional learning programmes that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment. These design principles address ten key themes that emerged from an analysis of trials of Courses 2 and 3 in the Educational Dialogue MOOC series. These themes included the ways in which participants engaged in the structure, materials and conceptual framework of the course. The design principles offer guidance and procedures for course design, but they also recommend careful adaptation in order to apply them to different contexts and courses (Bakker, 2018; van den Akker, 1999). They are summarised in Table 9.
Table 9: Brugha and Hennessy's (2022) Design Principles
Design Principle 1	Integrate accountability mechanisms in the design of the course
Design Principle 2	Provide a balance of flexibility and structure in the design of learning pathways and materials

5.2.4. Methods
Research questions
The purpose of this study is to explore how technology and online learning can be leveraged to provide theoretically informed professional learning opportunities for educators that enables positive changes in perspectives and practice. To achieve this purpose, we seek to answer two central research questions:
RQ1. Which features of the MOOC supported learning?
RQ2. What impacts on perspectives and practice resulted from participating in the MOOC?
We discuss the findings from these two research questions in terms of how they can inform and improve Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) MOOC design principles.
Data collection and analysis
This paper draws on selected data from the first trial of the Fundamentals MOOC, which was offered between February and April 2022. Evidence and findings are derived from two questionnaires (Appendix F) submitted by course participants prior to (212 submissions) and following (52 submissions) the live trial of the course. These questionnaires included a self-audit of practice to measure self-assessed impact of the course materials on educators’ practice before and following their participation in the course. This self-audit was developed and trialled by Gröschner et al. (2021). Further survey items were trialled during Courses 2 and 3 in this MOOC series.
Questionnaire responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and triangulated with other available data sources: discussion forum contributions (390 posts from 51 participants), learning artefacts (45 reflective reports), and reflective logs kept by the course facilitators. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with four selected course participants using purposive sampling, to explore their participation and engagement in the course, how the course impacted their perspectives and practice, and recommendations for course improvement in further detail. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically using constant comparison methods.
 The research constitutes a design-based process which allows for systematic course improvement through reflective practice and different iterations of the course (Bakker, 2018). It was one part of a wider design-based research agenda which included multiple iterations and sources of data from other courses in the MOOC series and cycles of designing, trialling and refining activities according to the evidence. Participatory design is utilised in each course in the MOOC series through actively seeking participant feedback at all stages of the course development, trial and post-cohort analysis. Indeed, this study builds on the previous work of Brugha and Hennessy (2022) in which prior MOOC trials for Courses 2 and 3 in the same series were analysed. This iterative trialling generated ten proposed design principles for online teacher professional development courses. The present research used these design principles to frame the data collection and analytical approach, both to address the research questions, but also as a testing ground for the principles themselves.
Course participants
794 individuals registered for the Fundamentals MOOC and were included on the weekly email listserv regarding course information and updates. This was significantly higher than the two main trials for Course 2/3 in the MOOC series, which had 39 and 28 registered participants respectively. Out of these 794 individuals, 212 completed the pre-course survey and self-assessment of their practice and 52 completed the post-course survey, 42 of whom repeated their self-assessment. 45 participants submitted a reflective report as their final learning artefact and were issued with certificates of completion for the course.
 Educators participated in the data collection voluntarily and provided their written, informed consent via the pre-course questionnaires to have their anonymised data and survey responses used for the PhD and Post-Doctoral research studies. Further information regarding both studies was provided via the consent form as well as the ‘About the course’ page  on the MOOC website, which included the researcher contact details for further queries. Institutional ethical approval was provided by the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge for this research.
5.2.5. Findings and discussion
Research findings are presented within five core themes, which emerged from the triangulation of available data. These themes directly address the two research questions regarding the features of the online course that supported learning (Themes 1, 2, and 3) and impact on perspectives and practice (Themes 4 and 5). Each emergent theme is also discussed in relation to the ten design principles from Brugha and Hennessy (2022). This section closes with recommended modifications to the design principles, based on the findings.
RQ 1: Which features of the MOOC supported learning?
Theme 1: Collaboration
Mechanical MOOCs attempt to eliminate barriers to access course materials by allowing anyone access at any time with no sign-up required. For the Fundamentals MOOC, any practitioner could view course videos, download resources and other related materials, and observe the discussions on the forum . Because of this open access, strategic accountability mechanisms were critical to ensure that participants collaborated with others in the live cohort and maintained momentum in completing the weekly activities. Findings from the Fundamentals MOOC pre and post surveys echo the requirements of Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 1, which recommends leveraging learning communities to address issues related to retention, as well as establishing a relationship with participants, and offering a mixture of self-paced and live options for participants to collaborate and interact. The accountability features in the Fundamentals MOOC included weekly updates and emails from the course facilitators, weekly assignments to complete (but not submit), and collaborative opportunities like the discussion forum, live events and research buddy system, which encouraged participants to complete the weekly readings and activities in order to be able to join discussions with others in the course.
Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 3 focuses on this interaction between course participants and recommends courses offer ample opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration amongst participants. This is not only an important component of the conceptual framework of the course (see Theme 3) but also for the motivation, retention and learning experience of participants. Evidence from this course trial supports this claim with pre and post surveys and interviews indicating the importance of collaboration for engagement and retention in the course. The Fundamentals MOOC is a semi-asynchronous course, which offered a live cohort; however participants did not need to attend live lectures or complete their weekly activities at the same time. This type of structure can offer challenges in providing opportunities for effective participant dialogue and collaboration. As such, collaborative activities were strategically built into the course structure in three ways: (i) a discussion forum, hosted on edudialogue.org, in which participants were asked to contribute to weekly as part of the course requirements; (ii) optional weekly live virtual events held on Zoom, where the group discussed the themes of the week and broke into small group discussions to address questions posed by the facilitator; (iii) the research buddy system,  which was optional for participants to sign up for, and involved matching them with another course participant to discuss the course materials in more depth at times of their own choosing.
 According to the post-course survey, out of the 62% of participants who used the forum, 90% agreed that it was helpful to their learning and 2% disagreed (8% neither agreed nor disagreed). When asked to explain their response further, one participant notes: “The forum was helpful as a way to make contact with participants, and to learn about educational dialogue in contexts I might not have had the chance to otherwise. For me, it was a written form of educational dialogue.” Another participant said the forum held them accountable to the workload: “I made sure that I kept up with the materials so that I could post in the forums each week. This helped me to structure my time and helped with motivation.” Recommendations to improve the forum included better functionality within channels and topics to ensure that discussions were easy to follow and contribute to. Further collaboration, beyond the weekly live events, included the research buddy system, which involved matching students with others in the course in order to discuss the materials in further depth and share reflections regarding the applicability of the materials to their settings. One participant noted: “Having a research buddy helped me a lot in keeping up the pace and having a vivid experience in the learners' community.” This experience appeared to be representative across all those who engaged in the research buddy exchange.
When participants were asked whether they felt that they were able to contribute to others’ learning in the course, 61% agreed and 14% disagreed (25% neither agreed nor disagreed). Out of the individuals who agreed, 72% of them received certificates of completion while 50% of those who disagreed received certificates of completion. This builds on participant feedback, which indicates that building and participating in a shared sense of community aided in the learning experience and outcomes of the course and retention and completion rates. Interestingly, however, when asked for recommendations to improve the course, most participants requested more opportunities for collaboration alongside more structured motivation and incentives or requirements to engage in the forum or in their research buddy partnerships. This is actionable learning for both course providers and course participants; course providers should include accountability mechanisms and opportunities for collaboration as an explicit part of the course design and delivery (i.e. build on Design Principles 1 and 3 to understand their relationship), and course participants should use and leverage each collaborative opportunity to enhance their experience and learning in the course.
Theme 2: Accessibility
Accessibility in this theme refers to the same constraints in participating and engaging in an online TPD course as presented in Brugha and Hennessy (2022): (i) participants with disabilities, (ii) digital literacy, (iii) familiarity with the concepts related to educational dialogue and educational theory, as this was a predominantly theory-based course, and (iv) available internet connectivity and devices in order to access course pages, videos, and the discussion forum. As recommended by Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 7, accessibility was positioned centrally during the course design process and individual accessibility needs were requested during the registration phase with adaptations made accordingly. This included the length and level of intensity of the course, available support for navigating the online platform, timing of and support during live events, and the ad hoc provision of structured resources and templates. The Fundamentals MOOC itself was designed to fill a gap for educators to learn the fundamental theories of educational dialogue before engaging in practitioner inquiry models in further courses in the series. Its objective was that participation in this course would make participation in the two further courses in the series more accessible through attention to promoting agency and enabling changes in perspectives and practice.
Demographic variables for the pre-course survey respondents to these questions (n=208) as well as those who filled out the pre-course survey and also completed the course requirements and received certificates of completion (n=28) are provided in Table 10.  This indicates commonalities of participants accessing the course as well as those who were willing and able to submit reflective reports. Numbers of participants are provided beside percentages to better understand the demographic variables.

A few variations emerge from this data. No participant 25 years or younger completed the course although 12% (n=25) of participants who completed the pre-course survey were 25 years or younger. Instead, a large increase of participants aged 36-45 years completed the course (50% compared to 35% of participants who completed the pre-course survey). Additionally, the ages of learners that the educators taught appeared to affect course completion rates, which may signify that the materials were more appropriate for those teaching higher education (i.e. 18 years and older) versus Early Childhood Education (i.e. 0-4 years). Also noteworthy is that while most participants did not have prior experience with MOOCs, 10% more participants who did have prior experience with MOOCs completed the course than originally registered. This signifies that previous experience with MOOCs may have helped learners develop the digital skills and comfort in an online learning environment necessary to engage in and complete the course.
 While the Fundamentals MOOC was designed with accessibility as a guiding principle, access continued to emerge as a barrier to course completion, as was cited by 29% of participants. This was because of language barriers, access to the internet and/or devices, and time zone conflicts with the live events. The demographic data presented in Table 10 additionally signifies that barriers included the digital skills of participants and their familiarity with online learning environments, as well as the appropriateness of the content for those not teaching in higher education. However, accessibility was not the most cited barrier to course completion. Rather, ‘Too many other professional and/or personal responsibilities and commitments’ was the most cited barrier, which is discussed below. This suggests that the course structure, materials and scaffolding of support helped mitigate this common challenge.
Theme 3: Reflection and inquiry
The full MOOC series was designed with the conceptual framework of inquiry-based learning in which practitioner agency and empowerment is front and centre to the course design. This builds on Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 8, which recommends that the course model and platform is aligned with the pedagogy of focus (i.e. the pedagogy that the course seeks to impart). In the case of this MOOC series, this is an inquiry-based and dialogic learning opportunity for a global community of learners. The success of this approach was evidenced through two key areas emerging from the data, which are discussed below in turn, and which participants reported as key components for oTPD courses: (i) providing opportunities for meaningful reflection, and (ii) enabling participant ownership and agency.
Creating opportunities for independent and joint participant reflection was a core component of the course design, and a feature of balancing course accountability with flexibility. This is recommended through Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 4: incorporate reflective activities in order to position teacher agency and empowerment centrally in the course design and delivery. This course drew on the learning from the first two trials of Courses 2/3 and the successes of practitioner-led inquiry. While the two other courses in the series have a more explicit observation or intervention inquiry model that is led by the participants in their own classrooms, this course employed the model through having participants lead their own reflective accounts each week and submit a final learning artefact at the end of the course that was based on their own exploration of the themes and materials and how those related to their settings and practice.  For example, how they adapted their practice based on the key concepts they took away from the course like taking a dialogic stance, interthinking or decolonising education. This allowed them to reflect on their own practice in detail, while simultaneously contributing to the learning of others in the course and considering how the theories might relate to different settings. The live events, discussion forum channels, and the research buddy exchange were all spaces that explicitly encouraged participants to jointly reflect on the course readings and materials and share the reflective accounts they wrote. This is aligned with Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 5: offer opportunities for participants to create and share artefacts. All courses within the MOOC series supported participants to create a learning artefact that could be built on by other practitioners.
The inquiry-based and dialogic approach of the course was also realised through significant participant ownership in the delivery of the course. This is articulated in Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 6, which recommends enabling effective avenues for participants to shape the learning environment. This level of collaboration with participants took place from the outset of the course, particularly since the course design was based on participant feedback from the first two trials of Courses 2 and 3 in the series. The course structure was continuously adapted throughout the live cohort based on the responses to the pre-course survey and the feedback elicited by email and within the live events. Participant ownership has also extended past the end of the course through all participants being invited to join a post-cohort working paper group to collaborate on research from the course findings. This group has published one manuscript (Brugha et al., forthcoming) is currently producing two additional separate papers.
Despite these avenues for participant ownership, however, when participants were asked whether they had suggestions to strengthen future iterations of the course on the post-course survey, four explicitly indicated the need to strengthen the amount of ownership participants could take on throughout the course. This included more leadership opportunities during the live events, for example, which was also feedback received from all participants in the first two events. This request is very promising as it enables Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 9, which considers how and when to scale back course facilitator support. It also points to the potential of leveraging learning communities, which can help displace the traditional training structure of an expert running a course, and instead reduce the scaffolding and support required through dispersing ownership within a community of learners. Longitudinal impact may only take place if opportunities for continued joint reflection between practitioners as well as between researchers and practitioners are available and are led in a main way by the practitioners themselves. The follow-up courses (i.e. Courses 2, 3 and the additional Islamic courses) offer a continued exploration of practice and were designed to build on the theoretical reflections from Course 1.
Theme 4: Flexibility
Designing for flexibility, whilst also considering the accountability mechanisms, means offering a manageable timeline and workload, while simultaneously encouraging participants not to lose momentum. It also means providing participants with customisable resources and options throughout the course, a ladder of support to access as required, and adequate space for experimentation. This is articulated in Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 2: provide a balance of flexibility and structure in the design of learning pathways and materials. One participant made the following observation regarding the importance of flexibility when asked what the most valuable aspects of the course were: “Flexibility in carrying out the course throughout the 6 weeks where participants were allowed to cover the weekly materials at their pace. Frequent updates and notifications were also among the valuable aspects of the course.” Another participant noted that the “online and asynchronous options were extremely important given [my] current workload.” These sentiments were shared by other participants in the post course survey as well as in interviews.
Nevertheless, the most commonly cited barrier to participation in the course was ‘Too many other personal and/or professional responsibilities and commitments’, cited by 67% of participants. Due to the open nature of the course, any participant was able to look at the materials and not commit to the full 6 weeks of the trial. Individuals who were unable to complete the course were told that the materials would remain online for them to access in the future. This likely had an impact on the retention of participants, since they were able to access the materials outside of the cohort and many admitted to delaying their participation to a time that was more conducive to their professional and personal availability. They may not have done so if the course materials were going to be removed. A key associated learning for educators participating in online learning is to take advantage of online cohorts where possible, or convene a group of colleagues to take the course together when accessing it ‘offline’. This contributes to accountability and raises the chances of completing the course, joint reflection (see Theme 3), and provides a critical opportunity for additional support in the access areas outlined above.
RQ 2: What impacts on perspectives and practice resulted from participating in the MOOC?
Theme 5: Shifts in perspective and practice
Participants were asked to complete a self-audit of their dialogic practices using the Dialogic Teaching Questionnaire developed by Gröschner et al. (2021) in both the pre-course and post-course questionnaires to monitor growth and regression in the use of educational dialogue in their teaching. The self-audit questions can be seen at the beginning of both surveys in Appendix F. Out of the 42 participants who filled out both the pre-course and post-course self-audit, 45% improved in their scores, 12% stayed the same, and interestingly 43% were shown to have regressed in their self-audit scores, sometimes significantly. Previous studies have also found that as participants gain a deeper understanding of dialogic practice through the course, they realise that their existing / developing practice is further away from dialogic ideals than they had previously thought. Although many forms of classroom talk can be useful for learning (Mortimer & Scott, 2003), the focus of this course is dialogic talk. Our findings demonstrate that deeper engagement with educational dialogue theories leads to a shift in participants' expectations of what classroom dialogue should be. The five participants who regressed the most all completed the course requirements and received certificates of completion. One mentioned that they had been using a dialogic approach for the last two years but “the reflections in forums and readings have given me more ideas and tools for creating dialogic space in my class.” Most of these participants also agreed that they were able to contribute to others’ learning in the course. In contrast, only two of the five learners who rated themselves with the top progression scores received certificates of completion and did not complete much of the course materials. This may similarly be because they had less access to reflective materials to accurately reflect on the theory as it related to their practice.
Because of the difficulty in measuring learning outcomes through the self-audit, the post-course questionnaire also requested information from participants regarding any changes in their professional perspectives and practice due to their participation in the course. Participants were asked to what extent their participation in the course had impacted (or was expected to impact) their practice. 63% of participants selected ‘A lot’, 29% selected ‘A moderate amount’, and 8% selected ‘A limited amount’. This scale is broad, however, and up for interpretation by the participants which made triangulation with the following open-ended question important. Participants were then asked to describe how their understanding of educational dialogue changed through the course. There were 47 responses to this question, with all participants noting positive shifts in their understanding through the course structure and materials. Out of these responses, 49% of participants provided detailed references of the materials that impacted their understanding the most, indicating genuine engagement. In particular, participants noted the importance of formalising intuitive knowledge they previously had. As one participant recalls:
Going into the course I had a narrow perception of the differences of different types of talks and their effects and the areas that they are used in. We were using them in the classrooms but we couldn't identify them. Throughout the MOOC, we have modified our lessons and teaching techniques to make use of the proper terminologies and prepared long term lesson plans to incorporate them into the norm.
 Participants were also asked to describe how their classroom practice had changed through the course. Out of the 43 participants who responded, 95% responded with descriptions of changes in their perspectives and specific practical changes that were the result of their participation in the course. Out of these respondents, 76% gave highly detailed descriptions of the changes that took place, involving specific actions regarding their lesson planning, group work, and sustaining this through long-term action planning. This is highlighted through one participant describing that they now give their learners “different roles within a dialogic group”, four participants specifically mentioning the benefit of introducing ground rules for talk into their lessons, and another speaking about reviewing their lesson plans based on their action plan and goals for enhancing their dialogic practices. Many participants also noted their knowledge from the course resulting in a confidence to enact their action plans. For example, one participant explains: “I am now looking at controlled activities in a new way to look for the places where I can open these up for student-led dialogue… I also feel a renewed confidence or strengthened resolve to stand up for a dialogic approach.”
Theme 6: Continuous adaptation
The ability of the course team to continuously adapt to the needs of the participants in order to produce a more meaningful course structure and content is the result of systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability.  This is described in Brugha and Hennessy’s (2022) Design Principle 10, which recommends that courses build systematic monitoring and evaluation into their structure. Systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course was built into the course delivery because of its roots in research; however, we recommend every online TPD course has a clear theory of change and logic model from the outset. The future iteration of this course, as well as other similar courses using the Fundamentals MOOC as an example, should also ensure that systematic monitoring and evaluation should remain live throughout and following trials and cohorts, and feedback loops should continue to elicit the voices of all key stakeholders and participants. This approach resulted in the ability to immediately apply feedback into the delivery during the live cohort, and simplified processes to modify aspects of the course following the trial. This also led to the development of an institutional memory, which documents the lifespan of the course. It is noteworthy that the monitoring and evaluation of the Fundamentals MOOC trial is not yet complete. All participants will be sent a follow-up survey in the coming months to assess their practice again and see what changes, if any, have occurred. This will aid in the continued analysis of the impact of the course and will be considered in relation to necessary adaptations to the course structure and content. The practical outworking of this finding for participants, is that they should be empowered and encouraged to participate in the available monitoring and evaluation mechanisms as their voices, opinions, concerns and recommendations will inform the design of the course.
Modifications to the design principles
Based on the evidence from this course trial, we recommend six modifications to the design principles. These are presented in Table 11.
Table 11: Recommended modifications to Brugha and Hennessy's (2022) Design Principles
Relevant design principle	Description of modification
Design Principle 3: Offer opportunities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration amongst participants	Design Principle 3 should include the following three findings: (i) The research buddy system indicated a promising avenue for peer reflection, support and collaboration, which participants considered impactful for both their learning and retention. We recommend courses offer a similar peer-to-peer exchange. Courses should consider how to offer a balance of structure and flexibility for these exchanges and how to automate the matching process using strategic criteria based on feedback from previous trials. (ii) The discussion forum and other collaborative activities, outside of the live events, should be intentionally asynchronous. This means ensuring that their use is conducive to a number of participants participating at different times throughout the week or even full length of the course. (iii) Allow space for participants to lead events themselves and functionality for them to plan and orchestrate this. This will also aid in the access of live events for different time zones and the development of internal learning communities.
Design Principle 4: Incorporate reflective activities for both local facilitators and their colleagues	Design Principle 4 should additionally recommend that reflective activities be explicitly and strategically embedded in course videos, resources and activities, including the use of reflective journals or other related templates that can be adjusted based on the unique context of the participant. There should also be an adequate amount of time built into the course for participants to employ their reflections regarding the theoretical or practical materials in their settings.
Design Principle 6: Consider the role of the participant in shaping the learning environment	Based on the amount of interest from participants in participating in post-course research, Design Principle 6 should additionally recommend that participants are offered the opportunity to contribute to associated course-related research.
Design Principle 9: Be intentional regarding the future of the course and consider whether and how scaffolding should be reduced for future iterations	Design Principle 9 should include the success of a multiple course model, which has been shown to bring together a number of the design principles. This course offers a rare opportunity for practitioners to reflect on theory prior to engaging in a more practical inquiry (Course 2) and eventually pedagogical leadership in their setting (Course 3). The expectation is that this results in an environment that progressively requires less facilitator support.
Design Principle 10: Build systematic monitoring and evaluation of the course into its structure	Design Principle 10 should consider the automation of monitoring and evaluation processes to accommodate a larger participant base. This could also aid in automating the ladder of support available for participants, which strengthens the potential of design principle 9 to scale back support and reduce scaffolding from facilitators.
All design principles	In addition to their current iteration with the above modifications, we recommend that the ten design principles are additionally articulated for course participants themselves. This should include how participants can leverage the design principle in order to enhance their experience and learning in the course. This can then be recalled during data collection to elicit their feedback regarding any further modifications required.

5.2.7. Conclusions
Summary of key findings
Through the launch and associated research of the Fundamentals MOOC, this study found the following ways to leverage technology and online learning to provide impactful, theoretically informed professional learning opportunities for educators: (i) the development and curation of course content and resources that are adequately structured in order to provide support to participants, yet customisable enough to promote localisation, (ii) providing collaborative opportunities between course participants through the forum, live events and research buddy system particularly when it involved challenging one another’s perspectives, and (iii) providing opportunities for participants to engage in reflection of the content through the customisable weekly reflective templates and final learning report. Impact appeared to be strengthened when the ten design principles were met, as described in all five themes, which indicates that the highest impact can come when these themes and design principles are addressed together in course design and delivery. Impact included changes in the ways that participants thought about their practice, and the enactment of theory into their practice. Participants also vocalised their desire to continue to be involved in the course community, which was a core feature of the mechanical MOOC model and the dialogic conceptual framework of the course. This is because the course aimed to not only impart new knowledge but to also curate a teacher community of practice.
The findings from this course trial support and build on all ten design principles presented in Brugha and Hennessy (2022). In particular, the evidence strongly supports Design Principles 1, 3, 4, 7,  8 and 10 in order to leverage technology and online learning to provide impactful professional learning opportunities for educators. In addition to the original design principles, we recommend: (i) the use of an intentional and structured collaboration system to include a research buddy exchange or similar and further participant ownership in arranging live events, (ii) the inclusion of explicit reflective activities throughout the course, (iii) the inclusion of participants in post-course research, (iv) the use of a multiple course model for bringing together the design principles and enhancing scalability and sustainability, (v) the automation of monitoring and evaluation processes, and (vi) reframing the design principles so that they are relevant to both course providers and course participants.
This research addresses a gap in the literature, which requires more rigorous evidence regarding investigations based in theory of the processes of teacher learning in oTPD, design considerations, and the accompanying impact on teacher practice (Lay et al., 2020). This research addresses this need in two ways: (i) through building on and refining theoretically-informed design principles for oTPD that promote teacher agency; (ii) through the focus on the outcomes of the approach on teachers’ perceptions and practice.
Limitations
A number of limitations in the study are noteworthy. The open access nature of the course is an essential element of the mechanical MOOC model, but this makes monitoring the course participation more difficult as it depends on participant willingness to participate in the study. This also made it more challenging to capture the voice of the inactive participant as well as the participants who began and did not finish the course. Similarly, the pre- and post-course questionnaires were not mandatory for participants to complete in order to access the course materials. As such, it was impossible to ascertain whether there were other users who completed the course materials, whose information and experience in the course was not captured by the research tools. The submission of reflective reports served as an indicator of course completion in some way, but it was entirely possible for educators to have gone through the materials, adapted them into their practice without our knowledge. We consider this to be unlikely but this remains an important area for future research to engage with; i.e. how MOOCs can reliably indicate engagement.
In addition, the reliability of the self-audit tool that participants filled out during the pre- and post-course surveys presented a challenge in accurately measuring impact. This is firstly because participants self-reported the change, which can have challenges regarding reliability but secondly, and interestingly, this is also because participants' scores were often lower when they had more significant participation in the course. As articulated in Theme 4, we hypothesise that this is due to increased educator understanding of deeper educational dialogue practice, which enables more critical self-reflection. This is an interesting insight into the self-audit tool, and indeed strengthens the argument for the reliability of self-reporting, but makes it problematic for accurate impact measurement as part of the research tools for the present study.
Future research
This research has led to a number of further questions and points of interest that should be explored in future studies. This includes: (i) The use of the discussion forum, including how educators collaborate together in a theoretically-driven course. This will be analysed and presented in more detail in an upcoming publication with the Working Paper group referenced above, composed of the facilitators and participants from the Fundamentals MOOC. This will employ a coding scheme to explore the new opportunities for dialogue that participation in an online platform creates. (ii) The legacy impact of participation in the course series. This will be explored through a legacy survey and interviews that will be conducted in the coming months to track impact as it has surfaced after the course. This will be reported on in future research, which will also explore catalytic impact of the other courses in the series and the extent to which the impact is sustainable and scalable. (iii) Further potential mitigation factors for addressing barriers to participation and completion.
The Educational Dialogue MOOC series presents a unique opportunity to continue to analyse the engagement in and impact of oTPD. Wider continued critical exploration of how online TPD can offer support for the formation and sustainability of teacher communities of practice is needed to adjust and build on the design principles. This should additionally include how to use technology to support teachers to enact high quality educational dialogue in their classrooms in order to improve learning outcomes and 21st century skills through a dialogic approach to TPD.
