## About me:

Hello! My name is Meaghan and I am fascinated with the affordances technology can offer education. While my consulting career has included research studies and evaluations on the use of technology in a variety of grades, locations and level of 'formality' in education settings, my master's research explored equity and access in MOOCs. Following from this, my doctoral research has utilised a design-based approach to explore this further and develop and trial three mechanical MOOCs for teachers.

## About my research:
My doctoral research study has sought to explore the intersection of online learning and dialogic pedagogy to enhance teacher professional development designed for school-level and higher education in-service teachers. There is a growing body of compelling evidence about the impact of teacher-led dialogue, and research that indicates dialogic methods in the classroom lead to improved learner performance. The literature makes it clear that TPD offers an opportunity to strengthen the quality of teaching and through this, the educational outcomes of learners. Effective TPD programmes regarding educational dialogue are therefore necessary to develop and trial to promote this pedagogy, as well as to explore how technology may afford new forms of interaction and dialogue among teachers pursuing online professional development.

The context of Covid-19, in which the bulk of this research study was conducted, created a sense of urgency in the development of online learning opportunities that are relevant for a wide range of teachers as well as virtual communities of practice for teachers to share good practice, resources, and support one another. Following the decline of Covid-19 isolation, this continues to be an important area for further investigation. Particularly as MOOCs continue to be subject to both high hopes for addressing inequity in accessing lifelong learning opportunities and significant criticality in who actually benefit. I studied this during my masterâ€™s research and indeed found discouraging results that suggested learners were from *include overview of demographics - can cite book chapter with Dr. Restoule*.

The research utilised the [Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue (T-SEDA)](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/), a resource that supports practitioners in developing dialogic teaching and learning and is designed for local adaptation. Three interactive mechanical Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) were iteratively designed and developed with the use of open source software that hosted associated resources and activities based off of T-SEDA for participating teachers to complete online. This research thus seeks to explore how technology and dialogic online professional development can support the development of communities of practice in which practitioners reflect together, support one another, and share practice.

The output of this research study is an iteratively produced and effective TPD MOOC series prototype on educational dialogue that is relevant for a wide range of in-service school-level and higher education teachers in varied geographies, along with the lessons for designers and educators learned from trialling it. This is currently housed on github, which can be accessed via the following link: [https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/). Beyond the production of an artefact (i.e. the MOOC series), the research is theory-driven with a primary focus on the pedagogy rather than the technology. This is addressed through the formation of design principles to include theoretical explanations to justify statements regarding the artefacts.

The research has employed a design-based research approach as the cycles of designing, trialling and refining activities are well suited to this study. Research methods were mixed for data collection and analysis, which involved analysis of MOOC site user data, a pre- and post-course questionnaire, discussion forum data, and data from key informant interviews with course participants, members of the T-SEDA team, and sector experts. The methods drew heavily on participatory approaches.

Three research questions drove the direction of the study.
1. How can technology afford new forms of dialogue to support the development of a teacher community of practice in which practitioners reflect together, support one another, and share practice?
2. To what extent can a MOOC afford opportunities to enhance dialogue between in-service teachers within an inquiry-based TPD programme?
3. What design principles help to make the model (i.e. a dialogic MOOC-based CoP for TPD) scalable and sustainable?

## About this course:
This online course has been developed to house the findings of this study in an effort to produce and disseminate open, accessible, and easily navigable and usable results. Indeed, since this research explored how to design an online course, it felt fitting that the findings be presented in a course - i.e. a course on how to design, facilitate and evaluate a course. This online course offers sections of my written version of the dissertation but in a format that was considered to be more appropriate to an online platform and course structure. In keeping with the conceptual framework and findings of the research, this course also includes reflective prompts throughout the pages of content. These were used for my own reflective logs throughout the entirety of my PhD journey, and are offered here as a resource while you engage with the research findings.

Please note that this online course version has been launched using open source software, which requires it to be open to the public in order for examiners to view the content. As such, and in line with university regulations, it is currently only preliminary to be confirmed following my viva.

The [Theory and Evidence section](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/theory%20&%20evidence/theory-&-evidence/) offers a review of the literature and evidence in the sector. This review explored the three main areas of the study: (i) educational dialogue; (ii) teacher professional development; and (iii) online learning and (mechanical) MOOCs. The literature review considered these separately and in combination.

The [Research Methods section](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/research%20methods/research-methods/) presents the methodology utilised for the study, including the stages of data collection and analysis, ethical considerations, and limitations of the research.

The [Intervention section](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/intervention/trial1/) provides a detailed overview of the intervention, i.e. the three course trials developed and launched, including a breakdown of their conceptual framework and their the structure and content.

The [Findings section](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/findings/findings/) presents the formation, trial and refinement of the design principles, followed by three case studies.

The final section is [Conclusions](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/conclusions/conclusions/), which offer a summary of key findings, implications of the research findings for the sector and recommendations regarding future research directions.
