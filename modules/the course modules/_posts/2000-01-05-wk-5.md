## Week 5: Identifying key dialogic features in the classroom


Welcome to week five!

This module will focus on analysing classroom talk through systematic observation and coding and provide guidance on leading colleagues through this process, including aiding in their selection of appropriate analysis and coding methods for their inquiries. This module will also include considerations regarding research ethics for conducting classroom inquiries. Your objective this week is to add detailed information to your facilitation plan regarding supporting your colleagues in capturing the right data for their research questions as well as how you will support them in interpreting and digesting the findings as a group.
