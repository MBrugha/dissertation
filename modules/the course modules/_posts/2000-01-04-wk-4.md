## Week four: Conducting reflective inquiries


Welcome to week four!

This module will review the purpose and steps of conducting reflective inquiries and will discuss ways of incorporating reflective inquiries into your facilitation plan, including effective mechanisms of support, collaboration and sharing learning. Your objective this week is to further develop your facilitation plan and consider ways in which teachers in your setting can conduct reflective cycles of inquiry.
