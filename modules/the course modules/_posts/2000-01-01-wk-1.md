## Week one: The role of the facilitator


Welcome to week one!


In this first module, we will discuss what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from a recent trial using [T-SEDA](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/). This will include the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators. Your objective this week is to identify (roughly) your aims for your facilitation.
