## Week one: The role of the facilitator


Welcome to week one!


In this first module, we will discuss what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from a recent trial using [T-SEDA](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/). This will include the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators.
