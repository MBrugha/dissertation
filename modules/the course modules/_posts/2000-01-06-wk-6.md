## Week 6: Continuing the role of facilitator
<br/><br/>
Welcome to week six, the final week of the course!

This week will look at the headway that has been made and invite you to share the outcomes or the progress of your learning and importantly - your facilitation plan. We will discuss how you will continue your role as facilitator in your setting, which will involve considerations regarding organisational structures, plans of how to sustain impact in your setting, and short- and medium-term facilitation goals and activities. Your objective this week is to articulate how you will support your colleagues to address aspects that need improvement (i.e. their findings from their inquiries), and when / how you will review the facilitation model and process itself to consider what was learned and what can be improved.

Please remember that you do not need to have a perfected facilitation plan as the learning output you submit – indeed, there is no perfect, standard plan. They will all look completely different from person to person and context to context so stay focused on what would be helpful for you and your setting.

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:

[Visual reference guides for facilitators](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/Facilitator_resources.doc.zip), which include a guide for planning your facilitation, conducting a needs assessment and designing your facilitation model, as well as a step-by-step guide for supporting your colleagues during their reflective inquiries.

## Do

Your task for this week is to finalise your facilitation model and plan. Use the resources above to help fill in any gaps, however please do remember that this will likely be a living resource so don't worry if it doesn’t look final! It may also be helpful to split your plan into short-term and medium-term goals and activities. You can also present your facilitation model / plan in any shape of your choosing (e.g. a diagram, a narrative overview, an audio recording of your explanation of your model). You can also provide a completed version of the facilitation plan template provided in the week 1 materials. The priority is for your learning output to be useful to you so please choose whatever mode is most helpful.

Your final facilitation plan can be submitted through uploading it on the [Week 6 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-for-facilitators/week-six-continuing-the-role-of-facilitator/) or by emailing it to me directly: meb78@cam.ac.uk.

After you have finished your facilitation plan and the discussion forum contribution for this week, please fill out the [post-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2H32Va8aMIWmqaCXDmy9lXn4pDrEzLNj7nQLz52WZPgNn_A/viewform?usp=sf_link) about your experience in the course. Your insights will be extremely helpful for my research and desire to create meaningful materials that are genuinely helpful for practitioners! Please note that you do not need to have completed all course materials in order to fill in the survey.

## Discuss
In the [Week 6 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-for-facilitators/week-six-continuing-the-role-of-facilitator/), please post a brief description or summary of your facilitation model and upload it to the post. You can also email the file to me directly if you have difficulty uploading it or wish for it to not be seen by your peers. In your post, please also include anything particularly surprising or challenging about the process of developing your facilitation plan.

As always, don't forget to comment on your peers' posts as well!
