## Week 6: Continuing the role of facilitator


Welcome to week six, the final week of the course!

This week will look at the headway that has been made and invite you to share the outcomes or the progress of your learning and importantly - your facilitation plan. We will discuss how you will continue your role as facilitator in your setting. This will involve considerations regarding organisational structures, plans of how to sustain impact in your setting, and short- and medium-term facilitation plans. Your objective this week is to articulate how you will support your colleagues to address aspects that need improvement (i.e. their findings from their inquiries), and when / how you will review the facilitation model and process itself to consider what was learned and what can be improved.

Please remember that you do not need to have a perfected facilitation plan as the learning output you submit – indeed, there is no perfect, standard plan. They will all look completely different from person to person and context to context so stay focused on what would be helpful for you and your setting.

## Focus of the week

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:

[Visual reference guides for facilitators](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/Facilitator_resources.doc.zip), which include a guide for planning your facilitation, conducting a needs assessment and designing your facilitation model, as well as a step-by-step guide for supporting your colleagues during their reflective inquiries.

Because this is the last module, I have also included some additional sites for you to find more information and resources, however this list is not exhaustive so make sure that you do your own searching as well!

* [Edudialogue.org](http://www.edudialogue.org): This website is a community hub built for practitioners and researchers interested in sharing insights, resources and support regarding the use of educational dialogue in their settings. Take a look through the site for more information about educational dialogue and helpful tools and resources for enhancing the use of dialogue in your educational setting.
* [DIALLS](http://dialls2020.eu/): DIALLS is a project that supports the development of dialogue and argumentation in young people across nine countries. This includes an excellent [library](https://dialls2020.eu/library-en/) of numerous tools and resources.

## Do

The activities for this week will be finalising your learning products.

As you’re refining your facilitation model and plan, use the resources included in the ‘Read’ section above to help fill in any gaps, however please do remember that this will likely be a living resource so do not worry if it doesn’t look final! It may also be helpful to split your plan into short-term and medium-term.

As mentioned in last week’s video, your learning output will be a summary of your facilitation model / plan in any shape of your choosing (e.g. a diagram, a narrative overview, an audio recording of your explanation of your model). You can also provide a completed version of Facilitator Resource 1 or 2 from the resources included in this week’s ‘Read’ section. My priority is for your learning output to be useful to you so please choose whatever mode is most conducive to your continued use of it.

Your model should answer or seek to tentatively answer some of the following questions among others, where relevant:

* How will you support teachers in identifying their interests and aims?
* How will you help teachers to narrow their focus and inquiry questions?
* How will you support teachers in designing their inquiry plan and methods?
* How will you consider the results together and ensure there is space for reflection?
* How will you support teachers in making an action plan for what to do following the completion of their inquiries?
* How will you review the inquiry process with teachers regarding capturing successes and challenges?

Your learning output can be submitted through uploading it on the [Week 6 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-for-facilitators/week-six-continuing-the-role-of-facilitator/) or by emailing it to me directly: meb78@cam.ac.uk.

Please fill out the [post-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2H32Va8aMIWmqaCXDmy9lXn4pDrEzLNj7nQLz52WZPgNn_A/viewform?usp=sf_link) about your experience in the course – your insights will be extremely helpful for my research and desire to create meaningful materials that are genuinely helpful for practitioners! You do not need to have completed all course materials in order to fill in the survey.

## Discuss
In the [Week 6 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-for-facilitators/week-six-continuing-the-role-of-facilitator/), please post a brief description of your facilitation model and upload your learning output to the post, if you would like to receive a Certificate of Completion (you can also email the file to me directly if you have difficulty uploading it or wish for it to not be seen by your peers). And you can also use this channel to discuss anything particularly surprising or challenging about the process of either developing your facilitation model or conducting your reflective inquiry.

As always, don't forget to comment on your peers posts as well!
