## Week two: Revisiting the theories and impact of educational dialogue


Welcome to week two!


In this module we will discuss what we mean by educational dialogue and review categories of dialogue. The module will also provide basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning.

## Focus of the week

_Please note that a video for the week will be uploaded prior to the October 18th trial of the course._

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:
* [A Teacher’s Guide to Dialogic Pedagogy Part 1: The What and the Why](http://21stcenturylearners.org.uk/?p=1337): This is a series of posts where Neil Phillipson explores “what dialogic pedagogy is, why it might be valuable and how a classroom teacher or school might get started with it”. Take a look at the reading list at the bottom of the page as well because it’s what I would also recommend for further reflection.
* Knight, Simon (2014). Creating a supportive environment for classroom dialogue. In: Hennessy, Sara; Warwick, Paul; Brown, Lloyd; Rawlins, Diane and Neale, Caroline eds. Developing Interactive Teaching and Learning Using the IWB. Open University Press. [http://oro.open.ac.uk/36484/](http://oro.open.ac.uk/36484/)
* [Talk in the classroom](https://player.captivate.fm/episode/492260c3-952b-4740-bacd-db94a28f1e54): This is a podcast by Neil Mercer.
* [T-SEDA section 1](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_wk2_resources.pdf): This is a section from Version 8 of the T-SEDA pack, which offers a helpful introduction to educational dialogue. Note that I have divided the T-SEDA pack into sections that relate to the specific weekly topic areas.
* [Wikipedia page on dialogic education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic_education): While I normally wouldn’t recommend a Wikipedia page as a resource in a course like this, I wrote this page a few years ago. Note that edits may have been made by other Wikipedia users since then and it looks like a bit of content has been removed but may otherwise also be a helpful starting place.

## Do

**Needs assessment:** Last week you were asked to begin a skeleton of your facilitation plan for how you want to collaborate with your colleagues. For this week, if you haven’t already conducted a needs assessment, this would be a good time to do so. This will likely involve conversations with your fellow teachers and perhaps also school leadership. The purpose of this needs assessment is to contribute to well-articulated learning objectives for your facilitation plan and ensure that the format and facilitation model you select addresses the needs and potential limitations of teachers. Your needs assessment will of course depend on your setting, but some of the things you should ask about and document are:

* How many colleagues you would like (and it is feasible) to work with
* How much time is available from yourself and your colleagues
* What the best ways are to meet to discuss (e.g. online, f2f, blended)
* How often you are able to meet
* Individual accessibility needs
* Individual teacher needs to be addressed through your facilitation (i.e. the learning objectives)
* Institution-wide needs to be addressed through your facilitation (i.e. what are you hoping that the school / institution will get out of the facilitation?)
* Challenges regarding engaging in teacher collaboration in your setting
* Potential ways to mitigate the above challenges

**Adding to your facilitation plan:** The findings of your needs assessment should be included in your facilitation plan and used to inform its design. As mentioned last week, your plan should also include the goals and driving force of your facilitation. This week, begin to also collate some of the resources and readings that you think would help to create that initial buy-in and add them to your facilitator’s plan. And don’t forget to include having your colleagues complete a self-audit before they engage in materials! [Here](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_selfaudit.doc) is a version you can use.

**Incorporating the following actvities into your facilitation**

While there are many activities that you can try out in the classroom to stimulate dialogue with your colleagues, I’ve listed two below from [OER4Schools](http://oer.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/OER4Schools) and have included related videos from the [edudialogue.org](https://www.edudialogue.org/) website but there are of course other activities as well that you will find on the edudialogue.org site so please do take a look around!

_Developing ground rules for your classroom:_ Using ground or talk rules can support student participation. Examples include:
* Only one student can talk at a time, and the rest of the group/class need to be listening carefully.
* Students must back up any claim or counter-claim they make with reasons or evidence. This is easy to encourage if students use the sentence starters above and use connectives such as ‘because’, ‘however’, ‘therefore’.
* Everyone is prepared to accept challenges.
* When students do disagree with their peers, it must be done respectfully and to encourage further dialogue. Asking challenging questions is more productive than confrontational assertions (not saying ‘no’, ‘you are completely wrong’, ‘that’s garbage’ but ‘Are you sure about that?’, ‘Isn’t there some evidence against that too?’, etc.)

The following video on ground rules provides a helpful overview, which is also available as Video 3 on the edudialogue site: [Practical tips for supporting classroom dialogue: ground rules](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/introductory-video-series/collection-1/#video3):

<br/><br/>
_Talking points activity:_ Talking points can be helpful in stimulating dialogue and opening up a space for dialogue in small groups or as a whole-class discussion. They can be open-ended and can be provocative or used to understand students’ comprehension about a topic. They should allow multiple ideas and views to come forward, and should encourage students to challenge each other directly. Examples of talking points include:

* Some people, like footballers, get paid too much.
* Things that give out light (like the sun) are always hot.
* Dark is a form of energy that is weaker than light.
* Throwing rubbish into a pit is a good way of getting rid of it.
* Recycling means that you don’t cause any damage to the environment.

You should also set up the response / debate system carefully and make this visible to students throughout the discussion on the board or on cards. These responses can include: ‘I agree because…’, ‘I disagree because…’, ‘I partially agree because…’, etc.

_Tip: smaller group activities will likely mean that students are more confident and willing to share their views, so this may be a better starting point before moving onto whole-class discussions. In small groups of students, one student in each group should be the ‘chair’. This student manages the discussion and makes sure all students in the group contribute._

## Discuss

In the [week two discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-for-facilitators/week-two-revisiting-the-theories-and-impact-of-educational-dialogue-3/), you can post about your reflections from the readings and resources and the activities for the week. In addition, consider the following questions when writing your post:

* What are the biggest challenges you can foresee in creating buy-in? This can include content-related challenges (e.g. finding contextualised content and evidence related to your setting) as well as technical challenges (e.g. how to create buy-in over Zoom with the teachers in your setting). 
* What element(s) of educational dialogue do you want to learn more about?
