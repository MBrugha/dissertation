## Week two: Revisiting the theories and impact of educational dialogue


Welcome to week two!

In this module we will discuss what we mean by educational dialogue and review categories of dialogue in a way for you to reuse and present to your colleagues. The module will also provide basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning. We will discuss ways of using these resources for teacher buy-in.

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:
* [A Teacher’s Guide to Dialogic Pedagogy Part 1: The What and the Why](http://21stcenturylearners.org.uk/?p=1337): This is a series of posts where Neil Phillipson explores “what dialogic pedagogy is, why it might be valuable and how a classroom teacher or school might get started with it”. Take a look at the reading list at the bottom of the page as well because it’s what I would also recommend for further reflection.
* Knight, Simon (2014). Creating a supportive environment for classroom dialogue. In: Hennessy, Sara; Warwick, Paul; Brown, Lloyd; Rawlins, Diane and Neale, Caroline eds. Developing Interactive Teaching and Learning Using the IWB. Open University Press. [http://oro.open.ac.uk/36484/](http://oro.open.ac.uk/36484/)
* [Talk in the classroom](https://player.captivate.fm/episode/492260c3-952b-4740-bacd-db94a28f1e54): This is a podcast by Neil Mercer.
* [T-SEDA section 1](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_wk2_resources.pdf): This is a section from Version 8 of the T-SEDA pack, which offers a helpful introduction to educational dialogue. Note that I have divided the T-SEDA pack into sections that relate to the specific weekly topic areas.
* [Wikipedia page on dialogic education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic_education): While I normally wouldn’t recommend a Wikipedia page as a resource in a course like this, I wrote this page a few years ago. Note that edits may have been made by other Wikipedia users since then and it looks like a bit of content has been removed but may otherwise also be a helpful starting place.
