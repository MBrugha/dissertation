## Week two: Revisiting the theories and impact of educational dialogue


Welcome to week two!

In this module we will discuss what we mean by educational dialogue and review categories of dialogue in a way for you to reuse and present to your colleagues. The module will also provide basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning. Your objective this week is to revisit this theory and impact and consider how it is applicable to your setting specifically and how you can present it to your colleagues in an engaging and accessible way to promote buy-in.

_Save the date! Join us during our Virtual Co-working Space on Saturday, Oct 30th between 2-4pm GMT+1 (London time). Pop in anytime to ask a question or just to say 'hi'. These virtual co-working spaces provide an opportunity to speak with your course peers to trouble-shoot any issues you're working through or just to work through the activities at the same time so you're not alone in your studies. Bring a cup of tea and join us!_

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:
* [A Teacher’s Guide to Dialogic Pedagogy Part 1: The What and the Why](http://21stcenturylearners.org.uk/?p=1337): This is a series of posts where Neil Phillipson explores “what dialogic pedagogy is, why it might be valuable and how a classroom teacher or school might get started with it”. Take a look at the reading list at the bottom of the page as well because it’s what I would also recommend for further reflection.
* Knight, Simon (2014). Creating a supportive environment for classroom dialogue. In: Hennessy, Sara; Warwick, Paul; Brown, Lloyd; Rawlins, Diane and Neale, Caroline eds. Developing Interactive Teaching and Learning Using the IWB. Open University Press. [http://oro.open.ac.uk/36484/](http://oro.open.ac.uk/36484/)
* [Talk in the classroom](https://player.captivate.fm/episode/492260c3-952b-4740-bacd-db94a28f1e54): This is a podcast by Neil Mercer.
* [T-SEDA section 1](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_wk2_resources.pdf): This is a section from Version 8 of the T-SEDA pack, which offers a helpful introduction to educational dialogue. Note that I have divided the T-SEDA pack into sections that relate to the specific weekly topic areas.
* [Wikipedia page on dialogic education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic_education): While I normally wouldn’t recommend a Wikipedia page as a resource in a course like this, I wrote this page a few years ago. Note that edits may have been made by other Wikipedia users since then and it looks like a bit of content has been removed but may otherwise also be a helpful starting place.
