7.2. Implications for policy and practice
The findings point to a range of implications for policy and practice beyond the recommendation for future similar courses to draw and build on the design principles to inform the structure, content and delivery of oTPD. Chapters 5 and 6 offer more specific implications related to the themes of the findings, while this section presents broader implications.
Courses should remain flexible and adaptive to the varied and sometimes changing needs of educators. This is strengthened through having a continued relationship with participants and utilising user-centred design. Through this, courses can better understand the user journey including what leads them to oTPD and what happens afterwards. This may mean designing a course beyond the traditional boundaries of TPD in recognition of how technology may support a continued community of practice.
In addition, courses should recognise that providing evidence by itself is not enough to change practice (Levin, 2008) and TPD programmes should always seek to go beyond the provision of research and enable the reconstruction of new knowledge into practice. The implication regarding this for course design is for courses to recognise learners as agentive practitioners who are capable of guiding their own development. This can encourage capacity building as not ending with the acquisition of substantive knowledge alone. It can result in a greater depth of learning and reflection, particularly when educational dialogue is used as a pedagogical tool to co-create new knowledge between participants.
Lastly, programmes must recognise the importance of engaging with all levels of the system, for example school leaders, parents, communities, and local governments to maximise impact. The role of the local facilitator acted as a mediator for the knowledge in the MOOCs and their local setting, which significantly enhanced the scalability and sustainability of the design. Despite significant numbers of participants dropping off the courses between registration and completion, those who were engaged and attended live events, collaborated with their peers on the forum and through the research buddy programme (in Trial 3), and used the tools and activities to reflect on the application of theory to their practice typically completed the courses. This indicates that the motivation of the participant significantly influences their engagement in the course and likelihood of completing it. Furthermore, if these individuals become local facilitators in their settings, they potentially have a wider reach and likelihood to create change in their institutions than this course could do on its own.
