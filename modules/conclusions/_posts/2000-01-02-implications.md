7.1. Summary of key findings
A summary of the key findings from the research is provided in this section, framed by the study’s three main research questions. These are themes that consistently emerged from the data analysis across all sources, which were pulled together through the mixed methods approach and triangulated.
7.1.1. RQ1: How can technology afford new forms of dialogue to support the development of a teacher community of practice in which practitioners reflect together, support one another, and share practice?
The way that this research question is phrased partly responds to it. The research findings indicate that technology can indeed be leveraged to develop a community of practice - with the use of a dialogic approach. Whether or not the dialogue that technology enables is new has yet to be understood fully, and it is important to reiterate that the findings highlight that it is not the technology that is paramount, but rather the pedagogy. This means that there is no one piece of technology that can act as a silver bullet to enhance dialogue and address challenges and barriers seen in oTPD. However, this research has made some strides in identifying unique dialogic features of oTPD spaces. These include the ability to co-construct new knowledge with practitioners in very different settings and opening a ‘dialogic space for reflection’ (Wegerif et al., 2017) using video and other online interactive resources, discussion forum contributions, live events, and reflective activities.
One of the most cited desired features for a community of practice was having opportunities for meaningful and varied collaboration between researchers and practitioners. This refers to collaboration between researchers, between practitioners, but also between researchers and practitioners in order to bridge the widely recognised research-practice divide. Findings from the research indicate that a dialogic approach can increase collective learning and participation. Collective learning occurs in these spaces through educators sharing practice and developing new knowledge through ongoing interaction (Sentence, 2016). This intentional sharing of diverse perspectives and reflective engagement with the differences therein can ultimately contribute to fostering a community of practice.
7.1.2. RQ2: To what extent can a mechanical MOOC afford opportunities to enhance dialogue between in-service teachers within an inquiry-based TPD programme?
RQ 2A: What are the key enablers and barriers for the use of dialogic pedagogy in oTPD programmes?
Dialogic approaches within oTPD were enabled through drawing on research-based multimedia resources to stimulate discussion and reflection. In addition, fostering a respectful and inclusive ethos within the course was imperative for promoting dialogic interactions. This is substantiated in the literature (e.g. Howe et al., 2019), which recognises the importance of developing a supportive and respectful culture. This fosters dialogue and enables collective learning. Confidence with the materials also appeared to impact the level of interaction teachers participated in. This points to the importance of scaffolding within these courses, and designing content to meet teachers where they are and to provide multiple pathways through the course (Escobari et al., 2019). 
Barriers to dialogue in oTPD spaces included continued accessibility constraints, as articulated below.
RQ 2B: What influences a teacher’s participation in online peer dialogue?
There are a significant number of factors that influence teachers’ participation and engagement in online peer dialogue within oTPD. Case Study 3 presents these factors, which are broadly summarised as physical, human and social resources (Warschauer, 2003). Physical factors include reliable access to devices and internet connectivity, human factors refer to the varied levels of digital literacy and prior experience with both online learning as well as the concepts associated with educational dialogue, and social factors involve accessing the course’s community and collaborative activities and events. These factors were both enablers and barriers to engaging in the course features, particularly the collaborative activities. This is substantiated by Baxter and Haycock (2014) who note that cultural differences may impede a learner’s integration and inclusion in the course’s community as well as their engagement with their course peers.
The reverse question raised in this section is how does online peer dialogue influence participation in oTPD and how does this influence educators’ perceptions and practice? The findings indicated that through the use of a dialogic approach, educators reconstructed knowledge products in a way that they were more likely to implement in their practice. This suggests that dialogue, in combination with opportunities for reflection, creation and the provision of scaffolding, contributes to shifts in perceptions and practice. Indeed, many participants described metacognitive changes through the above course features changing the way that they thought about their practice. This resonates with Seymour Papert’s (1980) constructivist theory, which argues learning is a reconstruction of knowledge rather than a transmission. This also reflects the evidence that indicates that dialogic approaches can increase learners’ capacity for dialogue and reflective thought as well as develop subject-specific knowledge (Alexander et al., 2017; Howe et al., 2019). Through dialogue within oTPD, teachers were more able to be reflective and use dialogic pedagogy more effectively in their own settings.
RQ 2C: How do in-service teachers perceive and experience online learning in reference to their professional development?
This research broadly conceptualised TPD as an ongoing learning process for educators to access relevant professional knowledge about curriculum and subject content and use this to promote student learning through appropriate teaching practices, reflection and assessment. As exemplified in the review of literature, there is a rigorous evidence base that suggests effective TPD offers an opportunity to strengthen educational outcomes for children through improving the quality of teaching. Pre-service education cannot do it all and cannot equip teachers for the long-term competencies and skills that are needed considering the rates of social, educational and technological change. Continuous TPD therefore plays an important role in developing and enhancing quality learning opportunities for children.
This research leveraged the conceptual framework and materials of T-SEDA, which is based on teacher inquiry. This can and should be differentiated from TPD. Inquiry-based professional learning is a practitioner-centred and practitioner-led process with cyclical learning activities, whereby each question leads to the creation of new ideas and further questions. So instead of this being a traditional TPD programme where a designated ‘expert’ imparts knowledge regarding subject content, for example, this is meant as a continuous process in which dialogue-focused inquiry is led by practitioners themselves. T-SEDA already offers this through its resources that provide guidance and support for teachers to conduct local inquiries based on their own interests. The T-SEDA inquiry-based approach is also aligned with the conceptual model of a mechanical MOOC and establishment of a community of practice, in which teachers from varied contexts can access the resources and adapt the support to their unique setting and practice, which facilitates teacher agency. Indeed, the T-SEDA trial findings found agency to be both a factor in pursuing inquiry and a result.
A mechanical MOOC is a different form of providing TPD, but teacher inquiry does not have a universal format. There are formal inquiries and ones conducted individually, but findings from the T-SEDA trials indicate that successful inquiries hinge on a combination of professional agency and wider structural understanding (Calcagni et al., 2023). This relates to meaning-oriented learning in which educators are viewed as self-regulated learners in professional learning contexts who are willing and able to construct their own knowledge (Vermunt & Vermetten, 2004).
Hood (2018) similarly notes the importance of autonomy in teachers’ professional learning contexts and the ability for them to adapt materials to their contexts. This is very much aligned with the findings presented in Case Study 2, which suggest that educators perceived oTPD as an opportunity to enact agency and autonomy in professional development instead of a rigidly structured programme that was structured as the transmission of knowledge. They additionally perceived oTPD as a flexible environment with time and space to be able to connect knowledge to their context, a curated resource bank to access materials for reflection and adaptation, an opportunity for developing online learning skills, and a platform for engaging with diverse perspectives. The ways in which participants perceived online learning in reference to their professional development significantly influenced their use of oTPD and its ultimate impact on their practice. 
7.1.3. RQ 3: What design principles help to make the model scalable and sustainable?
Ten design principles were developed iteratively for scalable and sustainable online professional development course models and communities of practice that promote practitioner reflection, agency and empowerment, and that view educators as valuable creators and contributors to professional learning resources. These are depicted in Figure 18.
 
Figure 18: Design principles
The findings suggest the need for accountability mechanisms, a balance of flexibility and structure in the course syllabus and materials, as well as opportunities for collaboration amongst peers. In addition, there is a strong need for reflective activities in order for participants to reconstruct new knowledge and adapt it to their unique settings. This demonstrably helped them to create new artefacts and knowledge that they shared with course peers as well as their colleagues within their local institutions. The cross-cutting finding that strongly emerged from all data sources was the role of the local facilitator to mitigate for many continued challenges and barriers with oTPD, particularly as they relate to scalability and sustainability.
Systematic and consistent engagement with participants was vital throughout the design, implementation and evaluation of the course series. It was clear that participants sought opportunities to shape their learning spaces and create their own artefacts, and that this had a positive impact on the sustainability and scalability of the course. Having relevant and systematic monitoring and evaluation processes incorporated into the course design can go a long way toward adapting course structure and content to be more relevant, engaging and impactful.
7.1.4. Contributions of the research
While the contributions of this research to the field are implicit within the design principles, this section provides a summary of what this research achieved and its significance.
oTPD research has been critiqued for its limited evidence, with very few studies exploring the processes of teacher learning in these settings, optimal conditions for oTPD, and the impact of oTPD (Lay et al., 2020). While the sector can call on research regarding in-person TPD to an extent, these findings are likely to be highly context-specific and modality-dependent. This substantiates the need for further research on oTPD specifically. This research produced the first MOOCs for T-SEDA resources that built on the theory and evidence from their model of teacher inquiry. Further theoretical contributions of the research include contributing to the understanding of the ways in which educators perceive and experience oTPD and the impact of this on their practice. The research resulted in theoretically-informed design principles in similar oTPD environments.
Methodological contributions of this research include its iterative, intervention-based design through the use of design-based research, which was capable of producing theoretical understandings of oTPD design and facilitation. In addition, the comprehensive and ambitious dissemination plan of this research seeks to address the gap in research and practice and share theoretically-grounded lessons learned with others in the sector in an engaging and accessible fashion. This aims to ultimately contribute to addressing the gap between research and practice and between what is provided and what is needed by individual teachers, schools, and communities. 
The literature also indicates a critical importance in developing and trialling TPD that supports educators in utilising specific strategies for dialogic interaction. The efficacy and identification of design features in oTPD are underrepresented in the literature, particularly as they relate to supporting changes in perceptions and practice. Pedagogical contributions of this research therefore include the focus on design considerations as well as the efficacy and outcomes of the approach on teacher practice. In addition, the focus on scalability within oTPD design addresses a gap in the evidence base (Hennessy & Davies, 2020). 
The intervention went beyond the current evidence to fill an academic and practical gap for educators where there is currently a need for accessible, effective, sustainable and scalable professional learning opportunities and underpinning theories that may explain what works well and what does not.
7.2. Implications for policy and practice
The findings point to a range of implications for policy and practice beyond the recommendation for future similar courses to draw and build on the design principles to inform the structure, content and delivery of oTPD. Chapters 5 and 6 offer more specific implications related to the themes of the findings, while this section presents broader implications.
Courses should remain flexible and adaptive to the varied and sometimes changing needs of educators. This is strengthened through having a continued relationship with participants and utilising user-centred design. Through this, courses can better understand the user journey including what leads them to oTPD and what happens afterwards. This may mean designing a course beyond the traditional boundaries of TPD in recognition of how technology may support a continued community of practice.
In addition, courses should recognise that providing evidence by itself is not enough to change practice (Levin, 2008) and TPD programmes should always seek to go beyond the provision of research and enable the reconstruction of new knowledge into practice. The implication regarding this for course design is for courses to recognise learners as agentive practitioners who are capable of guiding their own development. This can encourage capacity building as not ending with the acquisition of substantive knowledge alone. It can result in a greater depth of learning and reflection, particularly when educational dialogue is used as a pedagogical tool to co-create new knowledge between participants.
Lastly, programmes must recognise the importance of engaging with all levels of the system, for example school leaders, parents, communities, and local governments to maximise impact. The role of the local facilitator acted as a mediator for the knowledge in the MOOCs and their local setting, which significantly enhanced the scalability and sustainability of the design. Despite significant numbers of participants dropping off the courses between registration and completion, those who were engaged and attended live events, collaborated with their peers on the forum and through the research buddy programme (in Trial 3), and used the tools and activities to reflect on the application of theory to their practice typically completed the courses. This indicates that the motivation of the participant significantly influences their engagement in the course and likelihood of completing it. Furthermore, if these individuals become local facilitators in their settings, they potentially have a wider reach and likelihood to create change in their institutions than this course could do on its own.
