# Concluding remarks

This research study offers important areas of further consideration, particularly since new technology-focused professional development programmes and pilots are launching through a number of initiatives globally. Across this landscape, the role of technology to support teacher professional development requires further robust research to be better understood. It is the desire for this research to be built on in future studies in order to provide more equitable, engaging and impactful oTPD opportunities.

There is certainly no shortage of work to be done and research to be undertaken, however numerous positive results came out of this research indicating the growth we have achieved as a sector. Technology is a constant in the education domain (in every domain!), and this will not change any time soon. When thinking about the future of oTPD, the sector needs to consider models that are viable over the long term. The business model of MOOCs is clearly problematic and struggles with issues regarding sustainability. Therefore, the pedagogy should continue to be of central focus in the delivery of technology-enhanced professional learning.

The journey of undertaking this research has been complex and challenging, yet entirely rewarding. The learning that has come from this study is both personal and collective, as I continue to work with individuals I have met along the way. This has been transformational and helped me reflect on my role as a researcher and the interaction between research and practice. I am deeply grateful for this experience, and look forward to continuing to build evidence in this important area of research.
