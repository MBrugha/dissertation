## The Educational Dialogue MOOC series

This research resulted in an educational dialogue MOOC series comprised of three courses, based around some of the intersecting main research areas of the CEDiR group. These courses aim to contribute to a community of practice in educational dialogue. All courses were free for anyone to take and did not require registration or account creation to be able to access the materials. 

### Course 1: The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue

This course was designed for educators who are interested in learning about the foundational theories behind educational dialogue - both for participants new to educational dialogue as well as ones who wished to refresh their knowledge.

The aims of the course were to:
1. Introduce participants to the key theorists, methodologies and debates in the field of educational dialogue across all phases of education
2. Equip participants to reflect on their own thinking about dialogic pedagogy and practices in their contexts
3. Prepare participants for further courses within the series that support systematic reflective inquiry into their practice

Six weeks / units were offered. To receive a Certificate of Completion from CEDiR (with no formal accreditation from the University of Cambridge), participants had to complete all weekly tasks and submit a reflective journal of approximately 2000 words.

This course was designed collaboratively by myself and [Farah Ahmed](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/staff/ahmed_farah/ )![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb2cf231-efc4-41fd-b2f2-7c37d19a6f2d), a Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge. Farah co-convenes the ‘Cultural, religious and philosophical traditions in educational dialogue’ strand of the CEDiR group. The project for which she used this course as an opportunity for data collection is: Rethinking Islamic education for British Muslim children: a philosophical investigation of dialogue in Islamic educational theory and an empirical study trialling dialogic pedagogy in UK madrasahs (supplementary schools).  Farah is a member of the T-SEDA development team and has extensive experience in professional development for dialogic pedagogy and practice.
