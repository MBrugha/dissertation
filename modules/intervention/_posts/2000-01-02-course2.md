## Course 2: Conducting a Reflective Inquiry Using T-SEDA

This course was designed for practitioners to take their interest in educational dialogue further by using T-SEDA to conduct an inquiry into their own practice. This included separate segments for participants to work through the seven stages of the reflective inquiry cycle from T-SEDA, and included resources and guidance to support them throughout. Below is an overview of the reflective cycle.

Participants were required to submit a completed reflective inquiry report to receive a Certificate of Completion from T-SEDA.

Course 2 included materials from the T-SEDA toolkit, which offers varied resources, case studies and editable templates (T-SEDA Collective, 2021; see Footnote 9 for link). The content for this course has been migrated to and built on for [Camtree](https://camtree.org/) with the T-SEDA team. This course is now entitled ‘T-SEDA: A Model for Inquiry’. Taken from the course page, this course supports participants to:

1. Better understand educational dialogue and how it varies across different contexts and educational levels;
2. Understand the value of high-quality dialogue for learning, and develop familiarity with practical tools to promote it in their practice;
3. Develop familiarity with the tools for conducting systematic inquiry;
4. Use T-SEDA to plan, conduct and write up an inquiry into their own practice;
5. Identify implications for practice from their inquiry;
6. Share their inquiry, via a written report published on Camtree, so other practitioners can benefit.


The content of the inquiry strand of the first trial of the intervention was based on the T-SEDA toolkit and on the model of conducting a reflective inquiry into dialogic teaching. Content was derived from T-SEDA as well as additional CEDiR resources, and modified to suit a live online cohort. This was partly trialled during a three-part remote teacher training session on T-SEDA with a group of teachers in China in late August 2020. Two sessions regarding the use of the T-SEDA toolkit materials were led by my supervisor, Professor Sara Hennessy, and myself. Further content and resources via edudialogue.org were trialled during the PPD course.
The inquiry strand of the first intervention trial began with an overview of educational dialogue for participants to refamiliarise themselves with the underpinning theories and evidence. The course was then framed around the components of the reflective inquiry cycle in order to support practitioners as they conducted a reflective inquiry into their practice. This matched the weeks of the facilitator’s course (as described below) and included: identifying their interests and aims for their inquiry and considering research ethics for conducting a classroom inquiry; articulating their research questions; planning the inquiry and selecting appropriate methods and tools for data collection; conducting the inquiry and gathering evidence; reflecting on their findings; developing their practice based on their findings; and considering the process, such as what worked and what could be improved. Participants were encouraged to derive new questions from their findings to interrogate during another inquiry cycle.
Course 3: Supporting Your Colleagues through Facilitation
The content of Course 3 was similarly based on T-SEDA and on the cyclical model of conducting a reflective inquiry. The focus of the content was on the role of the local facilitator, the ways in which they could plan to support their colleagues in developing their dialogic approaches through utilising the T-SEDA reflective inquiry cycle, and on identifying potential challenges in order to mitigate them in their facilitation design.
Week 1, ‘The role of the facilitator’, discussed what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from the aforementioned IAA trial using T-SEDA. This included the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators. Participants were asked to roughly identify their aims for their facilitation.
Week 2, ‘Revisiting the theories and impact of educational dialogue’, reviewed understandings of educational dialogue as well as dialogue categories for facilitators to reuse and present to their colleagues. It provided basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning. The objective for participants this week was to revisit this theory and impact and consider its applicability to their setting specifically and how they can present it to their colleagues in an engaging and accessible way to promote buy-in.
Week 3, ‘Assessing the needs in your setting’, guided participants through conducting a needs assessment for their setting. Participants were asked to narrow their focus, scope and goals for their facilitation in much the same way they would support their colleagues in developing a focus for their reflective inquiries.
Week 4, ‘Conducting reflective inquiries’, reviewed the purpose and steps of conducting reflective inquiries and discussed ways of incorporating reflective inquiries into participants’ facilitation plans, including effective mechanisms of support, collaboration and sharing learning.
Week 5, ‘Identifying key dialogic features in your setting’, focused on analysing classroom talk through systematic observation and coding and provided guidance on leading their colleagues through this process, including aiding in their selection of appropriate analysis and coding methods for their inquiries. This also included considerations regarding research ethics for conducting classroom inquiries. Participants were asked to add detailed information to their facilitation plans regarding supporting their colleagues in capturing the right data for their research questions as well as how they can support them in interpreting and digesting the findings collectively.
Week 6, ‘Continuing the role of facilitator’ invited participants to share their outcomes or progress of their learning as well as their facilitation plans. This included a discussion of how to continue the role of facilitator beyond a round of completed reflective inquiries. Participants were asked to articulate the ways in which they will support their colleagues to address aspects that need improvement and when and how they will review their own facilitation model and approach.
