## Course structure and content

This section provides an overview of the course design process for each of the three courses within the series, as well as a description of the structure and content for each course.
4.3.1. Design process
Overview
The design of the initial course (that later became Course 3) began during the pilot phase of the research with an initial scope of the course structure and content, which was informed by the pilot phase data analysis. The course design was reiterated following each trial, and the final prototype was produced in Phase 8.
Pilot phase, PPD course, and course design
The pilot phase included the development of an initial scope of the course design, drawing on the available data. This included plans for the course site build, the course structure, resources, the discussion forum and data collection tools. Phase 2 then trialled some of the resources and the discussion forum with a PPD course, as described in Chapter 3.6. This 16-hour PPD module ran from October 2020 to January 2021 and aimed to introduce students to the key theorists, methodologies and debates in the field of educational dialogue across all phases of education, and equip students to develop their own dialogic practices and thinking (see Appendix L for module description). This was an opportunity to trial the structure of the discussion forum, explore the ways in which participants interact, and observe the use of the resources that could be adapted for the MOOC. This was particularly relevant because this module had to be moved to a fully remote offering due to Covid-19 isolations in effect. The MOOC did not replicate the content of the PPD course nor offer an alternative for the PPD course participants to take but rather it offered focused content on T-SEDA as a way for educators to continue their inquiries or work as facilitators to instigate cultures of inquiry within their own institutions. Indeed, the MOOC’s content was designed to be relevant for PPD course participants following the completion of their module.
Pragmatic perspectives that arose from using this PPD course as a jumping off point for developing a MOOC included the ability to assess the relevance and effectiveness of structures and materials. This initial data collection exercise allowed for an efficient use of time, whereby the MOOC design took place while simultaneously being able to test the structure and engagement of the discussion forum and online resources. Technically, it was also advantageous to trial the infrastructure prior to the first iteration of the intervention and it was additionally helpful to observe the ways in which PPD course participants engaged with the materials, what they reflected on in their own practice, and how they interacted with one another in order to leverage what worked, and address what did not (e.g. forum engagement challenges). This trial phase had limitations since the MOOC was not a replica of the PPD course, and therefore the attention was on areas of transferable learning. User testing was conducted with four participants on the edudialogue.org site, which explored the relevance of the content, the effectiveness of the functionality, the contribution of the site to developing a community of practice, as well as how engaging the pages of the site were and whether they would be inclined to return to it.
Once the MOOC was designed in full following the first three phases of the research, the provisional structure was circulated to facilitators who I had a pre-established relationship with from the pilot phase for their review to ensure suitability. Educators were then recruited to participate in the first trial of the MOOC through leveraging contacts through the CEDiR group, which has an extensive global community as well as through the key informants involved in the first two phases of the research (see Appendix M for the invitations to the different course trials).
Trial 1
Phase 4 of the research then saw the first trial of the course with associated data collection and analysis. Findings were identified, the literature and theory was again referred to, initial design principles were articulated, and adaptations to the MOOC were made where possible. Where this was not possible because of site functionality, for example, this was clearly articulated to research participants during the following iteration of the course; for example, the discussion forum was considered difficult to log into and while I was able to streamline this somewhat, I described the limitations of the functionality to new participants in the second trial and produced a clearer user guide. The problem was not fully resolved, but this went a long way in easing the challenges participants were met with.
The redesign resulted in a streamlined course for the facilitators, with the inquiry strand (i.e. non-facilitator participants) moved to a separate course. Changes were also made to the timeline of the course, the intensity of activities, opportunities for dialogue between participants, and level of structured support available. The redesign was presented to the T-SEDA team and facilitator collaborators to ensure appropriateness. This phase also reflected on the strength and validity of the data collection tools and analysis framework to see if any amendments were required.
Trials 2 and 3
This process continued for Phases 5 and 6 with the following two trials, and ultimately resulted in not one course but a three-course series. Since the theoretical framework of this research study was intentionally provisional and subject to changes through emerging data, findings from this formative analysis resulted in adjustments to the design principles where needed throughout the three trials. The final series and associated prototypes were developed in Phase 8 of the research.
4.3.2. Course structure
All courses within the series were built on github, which involved forking the ‘course-in-a-box’ repository and modifying it to suit the unique needs of this study and the intended participants. For this, a simple menu was designed, which included a home page, an introductory section and six weeks of course content. Figure 6 presents these three sections of the course site, using screenshots from Course 3 as an example.

The structure of the course incorporated a significant level of flexibility, because of the widespread recognition that conditions in most institutions do not support a strict schedule for professional development and educators are therefore unable to commit to something rigid. As such, a balance was aimed for in which flexibility was provided in the course through asynchronous activities and tasks alongside enough structure and synchronous events to ensure that momentum was not lost. Participants were told to expect to spend approximately 2 to 3 hours per week on course readings, activities and discussions. While participants were able to complete the weekly tasks at their convenience and according to their own schedules, it was expected that all tasks for the week would be completed by the 11:59 PM Sunday nights GMT each week. There were no fees for participants taking the MOOC and certificates were granted for the completion of a cohort from T-SEDA.
All courses in the series included six weeks of content, which were identical in their structure. This was modelled after Learning Creative Learning  and leveraged successes from other similar TPD MOOCs, carefully considering user experience. Each of these weeks offered the same structure for consistency: Focus, Read, Do, and Discuss.
Focus
A video was included for each week, which provided an introduction to and overview of the thematic focus. A transcript for this video was also provided for participants to download. This was particularly valuable for participants in settings with poor internet bandwidth.
 
Read
Relevant readings were provided, which included approximately two or three core readings and a few additional / supplementary readings for further exploration if desired by participants. This only included open access readings.
 
Do
Activities were included in each of the sections / weeks, and where possible they involved collaboration and discussion between participants. These included live webinars, individual study tasks undertaken individually or in pairs / groups with their research buddies or colleagues, and coding data exchanged with peers.
 
Discuss
A topic (or series of topics) was posed for contributions to the discussion forum every week to enable reflective thought and dialogue between participants. Appropriate functionality was in place to ensure that participants could ‘like’ and respond to one another’s posts. In addition, participants were encouraged and reminded to use the discussion forum throughout the MOOC and beyond for anything in addition to questions posed by the course facilitator. Participants were able to start their own channels, and were free to group themselves according to language, teaching level, etc., although they rarely took up this opportunity and the couple of channels that did emerge had very little uptake that did not last beyond the length of the six-week cohort.
The discussion forum required participants to sign-up and review community guidelines to access the channels for the course, which are included in Appendix N.
 
Edudialogue.org
The MOOC involved traffic to another website, edudialogue.org, for participants to use the discussion forum. The design of this website was led by myself and my supervisor, Professor Sara Hennessy, with input from other CEDiR members, to ensure that it was user friendly and relevant to the needs of educators using T-SEDA and other CEDiR materials. The site hosted the discussion forum alongside a range of resources related to educational dialogue.

 
This website was importantly conceptualised to run alongside the MOOC to contribute to a wider culture and vision in a community of practice. The importance of this is summarised by Facilitator G (2019 transcript, pilot research) as follows:
The main challenge is to provide this mass of materials and people speaking about it, and discourse and presence and pressure in order for all of it to be regarded as a culture … We're missing an effective dialogic unit that works and people can see it working, buy into that, get apprenticed into it, and since we're missing it, it's only bits and pieces.
During the pilot phase interviews, facilitators were positive towards the idea of a CEDiR website for the purpose of creating a community of practice more widely. Key considerations for the design of this additional site included: (i) Considering accessibility and engagement through ensuring that the website was not visually cluttered, was easy to navigate, was engaging with a consistent brand to the MOOC and other CEDiR materials and resources, and had considered issues related to physical accessibility. (ii) Collating and presenting quality resources that are easily searchable and navigable and offering pathways for users who know what they are looking for as well as for those users who want to be brought through the website from one resource to another. (iii) Conducting user testing with multiple individuals to ensure relevance and inclusivity. (iv) Modelling usage, encouraging buy-in and stimulating enthusiasm through my role as the course facilitator and through enabling engaged participants to become ‘champions’ to help stimulate conversations on the forum. (v) Considering privacy issues and how the website usage is monitored.
4.3.3. Course content
The course content drew heavily on what was already produced and evidenced. Courses 1 and 2 drew on some of the existing workshop materials and short videos devised by the T-SEDA and PPD course teams. Course 3 drew on the findings and needs of facilitators emerging in the T-SEDA trial reported by Hennessy et al. (2021). The content for Course 2 included materials from the T-SEDA toolkit, which offers varied resources, case studies and editable templates (T-SEDA Collective, 2021; see Footnote 9 for link). The rationale for using T-SEDA resources and the alignment with the conceptual framework of the course is presented in more detail in Chapter 2.
The courses also drew on further CEDiR resources and videos.  Existing resources were adapted where possible and allowed, in order to fit within the aims of the course sections. This included being branded with new CEDiR branding that I developed for the research group in order to provide visual consistency across websites and resource banks.
The content differed between courses within the MOOC series, which is summarised in the following sections. This provides a broad overview of the content, however there is significantly more available within the courses themselves. Examples of reading lists, resources and activities will remain available on the dissertation course site.
Course 1: The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue
The content for course 1 focused on the different theories and perspectives on educational dialogue in order to develop participants’ thinking about their own classroom practices.
Week 1, ‘An introduction to educational dialogue’, focused on understanding the distinction between educational dialogue and classroom talk as well as the relationship of dialogue to thinking and learning. It also looked at how dialogue differs from oracy and the relationship between the two. An overview of terminology was provided as well as an outline of the development of dialogic educational theories and practices. 
Week 2, ‘Robin Alexander - Taking a dialogic stance’, explored the ways in which attending to classroom ethos can support educators and learners to take a dialogic stance. It explored how subscribing to core dialogic principles might enable educators to develop a range of repertoires to facilitate teaching and learning.
Week 3, ‘Neil Mercer - Interthinking through exploratory talk’, built on the notion of taking a ‘dialogic stance’, by exploring the mechanisms of how thinking happens and is developed through dialogue. Neil Mercer’s use of the term ‘interthinking’ was explored to explain how dialogue enables knowledge and understanding to be co-constructed, in particular through learners working in groups. Interthinking was also discussed, including how it can be mediated through technology.
Week 4, ‘Sara Hennessy - Visualising classroom dialogue through dialogic moves’ presented research that enables educators to ‘see’ and evaluate the quality of classroom dialogue through identifying dialogic moves. These are descriptors that qualify what kind of statement has been made. They are used by educational researchers to understand what types of dialogic practices and moves support learning.
Week 5, ‘Rupert Wegerif - Opening up a dialogic space for reflection and agency’ focused on expanding understandings of dialogic education by looking at the concepts of dialogic space and dialogic self. This built on the content from Weeks 2, 3, and 4 and asked participants to reflect on how these dialogic ideas might affect how they think about their classroom spaces, and the learners within them. They were asked to consider why it might be useful and important to ‘widen’ and ‘deepen’ dialogue, how learners can be supported to make connections within their learning and with wider knowledge, how dialogue can support creativity, cultural literacy and intercultural understanding, and how to give learners agency and encourage reflection.
Week 6, ‘Paulo Freire and Ramón Flecha - Transformative, holistic and decolonial approaches to dialogue’, was the final week in which Paulo Freire’s conceptualisation of dialogic pedagogy was discussed. This week also explored how Freire’s ideas have been picked up by Ramón Flecha and operationalised in schools worldwide. We built on one of the core questions from the previous week: Is dialogue a ‘western’ idea? In this final week of the course, participants were invited to continue their learning journey through further MOOCs in the series.
Course 2: Conducting a Reflective Inquiry Using T-SEDA
The content of the inquiry strand of the first trial of the intervention was based on the T-SEDA toolkit and on the model of conducting a reflective inquiry into dialogic teaching. Content was derived from T-SEDA as well as additional CEDiR resources, and modified to suit a live online cohort. This was partly trialled during a three-part remote teacher training session on T-SEDA with a group of teachers in China in late August 2020. Two sessions regarding the use of the T-SEDA toolkit materials were led by my supervisor, Professor Sara Hennessy, and myself. Further content and resources via edudialogue.org were trialled during the PPD course.
The inquiry strand of the first intervention trial began with an overview of educational dialogue for participants to refamiliarise themselves with the underpinning theories and evidence. The course was then framed around the components of the reflective inquiry cycle in order to support practitioners as they conducted a reflective inquiry into their practice. This matched the weeks of the facilitator’s course (as described below) and included: identifying their interests and aims for their inquiry and considering research ethics for conducting a classroom inquiry; articulating their research questions; planning the inquiry and selecting appropriate methods and tools for data collection; conducting the inquiry and gathering evidence; reflecting on their findings; developing their practice based on their findings; and considering the process, such as what worked and what could be improved. Participants were encouraged to derive new questions from their findings to interrogate during another inquiry cycle.
Course 3: Supporting Your Colleagues through Facilitation
The content of Course 3 was similarly based on T-SEDA and on the cyclical model of conducting a reflective inquiry. The focus of the content was on the role of the local facilitator, the ways in which they could plan to support their colleagues in developing their dialogic approaches through utilising the T-SEDA reflective inquiry cycle, and on identifying potential challenges in order to mitigate them in their facilitation design.
Week 1, ‘The role of the facilitator’, discussed what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from the aforementioned IAA trial using T-SEDA. This included the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators. Participants were asked to roughly identify their aims for their facilitation.
Week 2, ‘Revisiting the theories and impact of educational dialogue’, reviewed understandings of educational dialogue as well as dialogue categories for facilitators to reuse and present to their colleagues. It provided basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning. The objective for participants this week was to revisit this theory and impact and consider its applicability to their setting specifically and how they can present it to their colleagues in an engaging and accessible way to promote buy-in.
Week 3, ‘Assessing the needs in your setting’, guided participants through conducting a needs assessment for their setting. Participants were asked to narrow their focus, scope and goals for their facilitation in much the same way they would support their colleagues in developing a focus for their reflective inquiries.
Week 4, ‘Conducting reflective inquiries’, reviewed the purpose and steps of conducting reflective inquiries and discussed ways of incorporating reflective inquiries into participants’ facilitation plans, including effective mechanisms of support, collaboration and sharing learning.
Week 5, ‘Identifying key dialogic features in your setting’, focused on analysing classroom talk through systematic observation and coding and provided guidance on leading their colleagues through this process, including aiding in their selection of appropriate analysis and coding methods for their inquiries. This also included considerations regarding research ethics for conducting classroom inquiries. Participants were asked to add detailed information to their facilitation plans regarding supporting their colleagues in capturing the right data for their research questions as well as how they can support them in interpreting and digesting the findings collectively.
Week 6, ‘Continuing the role of facilitator’ invited participants to share their outcomes or progress of their learning as well as their facilitation plans. This included a discussion of how to continue the role of facilitator beyond a round of completed reflective inquiries. Participants were asked to articulate the ways in which they will support their colleagues to address aspects that need improvement and when and how they will review their own facilitation model and approach.
