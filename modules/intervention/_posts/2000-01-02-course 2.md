## Course 2: Conducting a Reflective Inquiry Using T-SEDA

Course 2 included materials from the T-SEDA toolkit, which offers varied resources, case studies and editable templates (T-SEDA Collective, 2021; see Footnote 9 for link).

This course was designed for practitioners to take their interest in educational dialogue further by using T-SEDA to conduct an inquiry into their own practice. This course included materials from the T-SEDA toolkit, which offers varied resources, case studies and editable templates. This included separate segments for participants to work through the seven stages of the reflective inquiry cycle from T-SEDA, and included resources and guidance to support them throughout. Below is an overview of the reflective cycle.

Participants were required to submit a completed reflective inquiry report to receive a Certificate of Completion from T-SEDA.

The content of Course 2 was based on the T-SEDA toolkit and on the model of conducting a reflective inquiry into dialogic teaching. Content was derived from T-SEDA as well as additional CEDiR resources, and modified to suit a live online cohort. This was partly trialled during a three-part remote teacher training session on T-SEDA with a group of teachers in China in late August 2020. Two sessions regarding the use of the T-SEDA toolkit materials were led by Professor Sara Hennessy and myself. Further content and resources via edudialogue.org were also trialled and launched.

This course began with an overview of educational dialogue for participants to refamiliarise themselves with the underpinning theories and evidence. The course was then framed around the components of the reflective inquiry cycle in order to support practitioners as they conducted a reflective inquiry into their practice. This included: identifying their interests and aims for their inquiry and considering research ethics for conducting a classroom inquiry; articulating their research questions; planning the inquiry and selecting appropriate methods and tools for data collection; conducting the inquiry and gathering evidence; reflecting on their findings; developing their practice based on their findings; and considering the process, such as what worked and what could be improved. Participants were encouraged to derive new questions from their findings to interrogate during another inquiry cycle.

The content for this course has been migrated to and built on for [Camtree](https://camtree.org/) with the T-SEDA team. This course is now entitled ‘T-SEDA: A Model for Inquiry’. Taken from the course page, this course supports participants to:

1. Better understand educational dialogue and how it varies across different contexts and educational levels;
2. Understand the value of high-quality dialogue for learning, and develop familiarity with practical tools to promote it in their practice;
3. Develop familiarity with the tools for conducting systematic inquiry;
4. Use T-SEDA to plan, conduct and write up an inquiry into their own practice;
5. Identify implications for practice from their inquiry;
6. Share their inquiry, via a written report published on Camtree, so other practitioners can benefit.
