Course descriptions and trials

4.2. Course descriptions and trials
The intervention began with one course designed for local facilitators (Course 3), and grew to include two further courses. This resulted in an Educational Dialogue MOOC series.  These three courses were developed and trialled at different times, however they are all based around some of the intersecting main research areas of the CEDiR group and aim to contribute to a community of practice in educational dialogue. All courses were free for anyone to take and did not require registration or account creation to be able to access the materials. Table 3 summarises the courses, their associated trials and their current status (at the time of writing). Each course is then described below, and in further detail in Section 4.3.

4.2.1. Course 1: The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue
‘The Fundamentals of Educational Dialogue’ was designed for educators who are interested in learning about the foundational theories behind educational dialogue. It was designed for participants new to educational dialogue as well as ones who wished to refresh their knowledge. The aims of the course were to: (i) introduce participants to the key theorists, methodologies and debates in the field of educational dialogue across all phases of education; (ii) equip participants to reflect on their own thinking about dialogic pedagogy and practices in their contexts; and (iii) prepare participants for further courses within the series that support systematic reflective inquiry into their practice. Six weeks / units were offered, which are described in more detail in the following sections on the course structure and content. To receive a Certificate of Completion from CEDiR (with no formal accreditation), participants had to complete all weekly tasks and submit a reflective journal of approximately 2000 words.
Although this is Course 1 in the series, this was in fact the last course to be developed. It was created based on feedback from local facilitators from the first two trials who wanted a ‘beginner’s’ online course on educational dialogue that took a similar shape to their own facilitator’s course for them to bring their colleagues through; i.e. they wished to facilitate their colleagues’ participation in a MOOC that introduced them to the fundamentals of educational dialogue. This was considered advantageous to the aims of the intervention, and so the course was designed collaboratively by myself and Farah Ahmed, a Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge. Farah co-convenes the ‘Cultural, religious and philosophical traditions in educational dialogue’ strand of the CEDiR group. The project for which she used this course as an opportunity for data collection is: Rethinking Islamic education for British Muslim children: a philosophical investigation of dialogue in Islamic educational theory and an empirical study trialling dialogic pedagogy in UK madrasahs (supplementary schools).  Farah is a member of the T-SEDA development team and has extensive experience in professional development for dialogic pedagogy and practice.
4.2.2. Course 2: Conducting a Reflective Inquiry Using T-SEDA
This course was initially trialled as one of two strands in the first trial of the intervention. While Trial 1 was predominantly designed for local facilitators (now Course 3), educators who wanted to trial the T-SEDA toolkit themselves were also welcome to attend the course in a separate strand in order to avoid excluding practitioners who wanted to become better equipped with the inquiry process prior to becoming a local facilitator. Trial 1 thus incorporated both Courses 2 and 3, which worked well because they went through the same reflective inquiry components and those participants taking the facilitator’s strand of the course were able to observe the practitioner's real experiences using T-SEDA. In fact, there were colleagues doing one strand each in the first trial who used their collective experience to start a dialogic project within their institution (this project is featured as part of the data collected for Case Study 1). However, it was considered too difficult to manage administratively, and a new course for the ‘Inquirer’ strand (now Course 2) was developed to make the aims and materials clearer and the course series more navigable for new participants.
This course was designed for practitioners to take their interest in educational dialogue further by using T-SEDA to conduct an inquiry into their own practice. This included separate segments for participants to work through the seven stages of the reflective inquiry cycle from T-SEDA, and included resources and guidance to support them throughout. Figure 5 presents an overview of the reflective cycle.

Participants were required to submit a completed reflective inquiry report to receive a Certificate of Completion from T-SEDA.
Once this strand was separated into Course 2, it was never trialled as a separate offering, however the content has been migrated to and built on for Camtree with the T-SEDA team. This course is now entitled ‘T-SEDA: A Model for Inquiry’. Taken from the course page (currently being trialled at the time of writing and not yet available for public consumption), this course supports participants to: (i) better understand educational dialogue and how it varies across different contexts and educational levels; (ii) understand the value of high-quality dialogue for learning, and develop familiarity with practical tools to promote it in their practice; (iii) develop familiarity with the tools for conducting systematic inquiry; (iv) use T-SEDA to plan, conduct and write up an inquiry into their own practice; (v) identify implications for practice from their inquiry; (vi) share their inquiry, via a written report published on Camtree, so other practitioners can benefit. The structure of the course drew on what was used in the MOOC, as described in Chapter 4.3, with new video and audio tutorials filmed by members of the T-SEDA collective, readings and resources, reflective prompts to guide participants’ thinking and writing guidance for completing sections of their inquiry reports.
4.2.3. Course 3: Supporting Your Colleagues through Facilitation
‘Supporting Your Colleagues through Facilitation’ was the initial course that was designed for this research study, because of the recognised critical role that local facilitators have in coordinating and supporting teachers to use the T-SEDA toolkit. This course was therefore designed for teachers and teacher educators in schools and tertiary institutions globally who had familiarity with educational dialogue and wanted to support their colleagues in developing their dialogic practices. This course offered six weeks of segments that aimed to equip learners with the theory, methodologies, tools and resources to support other practitioners in developing their dialogic approaches. The course offered detailed resources and guidance for practitioners to develop a comprehensive facilitation plan that carefully considered each area of the reflective inquiry cycle and the ways in which they can support their colleagues to move through it. Participants were required to submit a comprehensive facilitation plan in order to receive a Certificate of Completion from T-SEDA.
