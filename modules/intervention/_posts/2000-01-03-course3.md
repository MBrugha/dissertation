## Course 3: Supporting Your Colleagues through Facilitation

This course recognises the critical role that local facilitators have in coordinating and supporting teachers to use the T-SEDA toolkit. This was therefore designed for teachers and teacher educators in schools and tertiary institutions globally who had familiarity with educational dialogue and wanted to support their colleagues in developing their dialogic practices. This course offers six weeks of segments that aim to equip learners with the theory, methodologies, tools and resources to support other practitioners in developing their dialogic approaches. The course offers detailed resources and guidance for practitioners to develop a comprehensive facilitation plan that carefully considers each area of the reflective inquiry cycle and the ways in which they can support their colleagues to move through it. Participants are required to submit a comprehensive facilitation plan in order to receive a Certificate of Completion from T-SEDA.
