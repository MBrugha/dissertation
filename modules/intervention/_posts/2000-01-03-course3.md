## Course 3: Supporting Your Colleagues through Facilitation

This course recognises the critical role that local facilitators have in coordinating and supporting teachers to use the T-SEDA toolkit. This was therefore designed for teachers and teacher educators in schools and tertiary institutions globally who had familiarity with educational dialogue and wanted to support their colleagues in developing their dialogic practices. This course offers six weeks of segments that aim to equip learners with the theory, methodologies, tools and resources to support other practitioners in developing their dialogic approaches. The course offers detailed resources and guidance for practitioners to develop a comprehensive facilitation plan that carefully considers each area of the reflective inquiry cycle and the ways in which they can support their colleagues to move through it. Participants are required to submit a comprehensive facilitation plan in order to receive a Certificate of Completion from T-SEDA.

Course 3: Supporting Your Colleagues through Facilitation
The content of Course 3 was similarly based on T-SEDA and on the cyclical model of conducting a reflective inquiry. The focus of the content was on the role of the local facilitator, the ways in which they could plan to support their colleagues in developing their dialogic approaches through utilising the T-SEDA reflective inquiry cycle, and on identifying potential challenges in order to mitigate them in their facilitation design.
Week 1, ‘The role of the facilitator’, discussed what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from the aforementioned IAA trial using T-SEDA. This included the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators. Participants were asked to roughly identify their aims for their facilitation.
Week 2, ‘Revisiting the theories and impact of educational dialogue’, reviewed understandings of educational dialogue as well as dialogue categories for facilitators to reuse and present to their colleagues. It provided basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning. The objective for participants this week was to revisit this theory and impact and consider its applicability to their setting specifically and how they can present it to their colleagues in an engaging and accessible way to promote buy-in.
Week 3, ‘Assessing the needs in your setting’, guided participants through conducting a needs assessment for their setting. Participants were asked to narrow their focus, scope and goals for their facilitation in much the same way they would support their colleagues in developing a focus for their reflective inquiries.
Week 4, ‘Conducting reflective inquiries’, reviewed the purpose and steps of conducting reflective inquiries and discussed ways of incorporating reflective inquiries into participants’ facilitation plans, including effective mechanisms of support, collaboration and sharing learning.
Week 5, ‘Identifying key dialogic features in your setting’, focused on analysing classroom talk through systematic observation and coding and provided guidance on leading their colleagues through this process, including aiding in their selection of appropriate analysis and coding methods for their inquiries. This also included considerations regarding research ethics for conducting classroom inquiries. Participants were asked to add detailed information to their facilitation plans regarding supporting their colleagues in capturing the right data for their research questions as well as how they can support them in interpreting and digesting the findings collectively.
Week 6, ‘Continuing the role of facilitator’ invited participants to share their outcomes or progress of their learning as well as their facilitation plans. This included a discussion of how to continue the role of facilitator beyond a round of completed reflective inquiries. Participants were asked to articulate the ways in which they will support their colleagues to address aspects that need improvement and when and how they will review their own facilitation model and approach.
