## Theory and evidence behind the research

An extensive literature review was carried out prior to the research. This was revisited throughout the data collection phases, as described in the methodology. This page provides a summary of the literature and the approach to the review, and the following three sub-modules offer more detailed overviews of the specific subject matter: educational dialogue, teacher professional development, and online learning and MOOCs.

The literature review explored the three main areas whose intersection framed the intended research study: (i) educational dialogue; (ii) teacher professional development; and (iii) online learning and MOOCs. These areas were considered separately and in combination. The literature was continuously revisited over the course of the study to ensure that the research remained grounded in current evidence. This was particularly important considering the focus of the research on technology-enhanced learning and the constantly changing landscape and evidence base.

Literature reviews are also included in each of the publications in the findings sections in order to ground the findings in the current and relevant evidence base.

*An overview of the evidence will be included on this page once finalised, as an output of the literature review. 

This resource has been designed for users to be able to easily review the evidence regarding oTPD. This is an organisational tool that correlates references from this dissertation and categorises them according to their thematic foci. Limitations exist with developing an evidence resource of this nature, however, which include the complexity of educational change and the recognition that research in this domain is continuously developed. This resource should therefore be used with caution and the recognition that the evidence is best engaged with individually and in depth. In addition, this should be used with an awareness that the field is constantly producing more research. It has been listed as open-access licence CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for further research to build on what is there.

## Search strategy
A search strategy was developed through an iterative process. Search strings were formed by identifying the key terms and phrases that reflected the central themes of the research, with search specifiers.

Base search terms	Search specifiers
1.	Dialog* [pedagogy OR education OR learning OR teaching]
2.	Teacher professional development OR TPD OR [in-service] teacher [training OR education OR learning] OR continuous professional development OR CPD OR teacher inquiry	1.	[Online OR blended OR hybrid OR networked OR distributed] [learning OR education OR professional development]; e-learning OR elearning; mobile learning OR mlearning
2.	Technolog*

Dates and geographies for searching literature were not restricted, however I was unable to include studies in other languages other than English. Initial searches yielded thousands of results, many of which were found to be irrelevant to this study, so the search strategy was refined. References from highly relevant articles were also examined in order to identify key texts and other potentially relevant publications. As themes emerged from initial findings, further ad hoc searches were conducted to incorporate associated theory and evidence into the research. This included targeted literature on digital inclusion, teacher agency, metacognitive change, and knowledge mobilisation, which is featured in the background sections of the findings in Chapters 5 and 6.
