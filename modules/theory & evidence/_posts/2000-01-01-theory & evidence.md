# Theory and evidence behind the research

An extensive literature review was carried out prior to the research. This was revisited throughout the data collection phases. As you review the literature that is most relevant for your interests and context, reflect on the following:

_1. How do you weigh the strength of evidence? What characteristics do you look for that might indicate a high quality research study (e.g. having a clear hypothesis and research questions that recognise the current evidence; reliable and valid data; etc.)?
2. How do you decide on which studies you will read? E.g. through what colleagues send you, through social media, etc.
3. How can we do a better job in the sector at mobilising evidence in an accessible and engaging way?_

The following resource has been designed for users to be able to easily review the evidence regarding oTPD. I recommend using this resource with caution - it can be a helpful organisational tool that correlates studies according to their focus areas, but utlimately evidence is best engaged with individually and in depth. The field is also constantly producing more research so this is not an exhaustive list.

_**An overview of the evidence will be included on this page once finalised, as an output of the literature review.**_

The following three sections offer overviews of: educational dialogue, teacher professional development, and online learning networks and MOOCs. Note that literature reviews are also included in each of the publications on the findings page.
