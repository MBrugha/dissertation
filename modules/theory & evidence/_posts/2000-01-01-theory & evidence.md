# Theory and evidence behind the research

An extensive literature review was carried out prior to the research. This was revisited throughout the data collection phases. This page provides a summary of the literature and the approach to the review. The following three sections offer more detailed overviews of: educational dialogue, teacher professional development, and online learning networks and MOOCs. Literature reviews are also included in each of the publications on the findings page.

The following resource has been designed for users to be able to easily review the evidence regarding oTPD. I recommend using this resource with caution - it can be a helpful organisational tool that correlates studies according to their focus areas, but utlimately evidence is best engaged with individually and in depth. The field is also constantly producing more research so this is not an exhaustive list.

_**An overview of the evidence will be included on this page once finalised, as an output of the literature review.**_
