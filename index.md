Hello and a very warm welcome to this site! 

This is the home of my doctoral research 'Dialogic Online Teacher Professional Development: The Use of Technology to Build a Community of Practice in Educational Dialogue'. This study explores the intersection of technology and educational dialogue to enhance teacher professional development designed for school-level and higher education in-service teachers. As part of the research, three courses were developed and trialled for educators in the form of mechanical MOOCs using this same site structure. It seemed fitting to use my learning from facilitating online courses to create an accessible format to present the results of research. On this site you will find the theory, evidence and literature the study was founded upon, the research methodology utilised, the findings, and concluding remarks. Links have been included throughout to the courses that were run so that you can see first-hand what participants experiencesd.

It is my hope that the presentation of research via a website in course format like this will help disseminate my findings in an engaging, accessible, open and reflexive way. All content housed on this site is freely accessible to anyone. Recommended citations have been included on each page if you would like to reuuse the content.

Thanks for visiting, and enjoy!

## The website
There are 5 main sections that walk you through the dissertation structure and findings. Each of these sections are framed as modules with sub-modules within them to mimic the structure of a course.
* **[Introduction to the course](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/introduction/introduction/)** - Learn more about me, about my research, and about this dissertation site and how to navigate it.
* **[Theory and evidence](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/theory%20&%20evidence/theory-&-evidence/)** - This section houses relevant literature, including the theory and evidence the research was based upon.
* **[The research study methodology](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/research%20methods/research-methods/)** - This provides an overview of the methodology of the study, including the use of design-based research, an overview of research phases including data collection and analysis, and ethical considerations for the study.
* **[The findings](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/findings/findings/)** - This section houses three areas of findings from the study: 
  * **[Supporting the development of an online teacher community of practice](https://mbrugha.github.io/dissertation/modules/findings/online-teacher-CoP/)**
